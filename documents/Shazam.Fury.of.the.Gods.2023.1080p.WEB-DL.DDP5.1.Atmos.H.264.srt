2
00:01:07,902 --> 00:01:10,538
The lore tells us
of a valiant few

3
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,307
who stood above the fray
and fog.

4
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,777
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

5
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,211
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

6
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,748
the mythical staff
of the gods.

7
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,517
In Homer's tale,

8
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,754
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

9
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,791
Oh.
Welcome, proud soldiers.

10
00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,124
What did I say?

11
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,492
Museums are fun.

12
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:35,462
Amusement parks
for the brains.

13
00:01:35,495 --> 00:01:37,264
- Whoa!
- Okay,

14
00:01:37,297 --> 00:01:38,566
there's no reason
to get pushy.

15
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,902
Everyone will get a chance
to see it.

16
00:01:40,935 --> 00:01:42,503
Carved from a heartwood

17
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:44,906
not seen in over 2,000 years,

18
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,374
the two halves
of this ancient replica

19
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,611
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

20
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:53,313
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

21
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,649
So strong,
they reportedly broke

22
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,618
three trash compactors.

23
00:01:56,651 --> 00:01:58,853
Okay, um, friends,
that's enough.

24
00:01:58,886 --> 00:02:01,388
I'm, I'm sort of the star
of the show here...

25
00:02:01,421 --> 00:02:03,290
Stop!

26
00:02:03,323 --> 00:02:04,424
Stop! Sir!

27
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:07,394
Sir!

28
00:02:09,329 --> 00:02:10,732
Hey!

29
00:02:10,765 --> 00:02:12,299
Hey, what are you doing?

30
00:02:55,910 --> 00:02:59,647
Unleash the chaos.

31
00:03:05,820 --> 00:03:07,722
Unleash the chaos.

32
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,498
Unleash the chaos.

33
00:03:35,550 --> 00:03:36,951
Wait,
wait. Move, move, move!

34
00:03:40,755 --> 00:03:41,756
No, no!

35
00:03:43,624 --> 00:03:44,625
Help me!

36
00:04:05,813 --> 00:04:07,347
No!

37
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:10,317
Ladies, please just let me go.

38
00:04:14,956 --> 00:04:16,591
Oh, my God! Look out!

39
00:05:00,668 --> 00:05:02,770
Turns out museums are fun.

40
00:05:06,741 --> 00:05:08,475
Let's have more of it.

41
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,579
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

42
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,981
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

43
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,118
Human champions
are still humans

44
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,953
and we are gods.

45
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,889
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

46
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,125
To protect the power
of the gods,

47
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,961
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

48
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,832
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

49
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,134
this realm has ever witnessed.

50
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,803
I'm an idiot.

51
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,872
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

52
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,674
Like, what am I even
contributing?

53
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,609
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

54
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,743
with a lightning bolt on it

55
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,846
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

56
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,649
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

57
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,951
and Batman is so cool!

58
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,053
And I'm just me.

59
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,621
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

60
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,022
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

61
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,958
but I feel like

62
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,092
a fraud.

63
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,594
You understand I'm a...

64
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,963
pediatrician,

65
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,733
right?

66
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,802
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

67
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,604
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

68
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,905
It doesn't matter.

69
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,773
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

70
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,742
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

71
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,143
All right, look.

72
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,812
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

73
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,780
but it sounds to me like

74
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,650
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

75
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,887
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

76
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,488
so if you don't
mind me asking,

77
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,524
how well do you remember
your childhood?

78
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,926
Like it was today.

79
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,829
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

80
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,463
I mean, I never met my dad.

81
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,834
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

82
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,468
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

83
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,570
ran away from 11 homes,

84
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,804
got into a lot of fights.

85
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,039
Then I was abducted
by a wizard

86
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,674
who gave me superpowers

87
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,209
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

88
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,610
That's not a small amount.

89
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,978
A doctor conjured seven demons

90
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,546
and held my whole family
hostage,

91
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,915
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

92
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,750
and then everybody
got superpowers,

93
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,585
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

94
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,153
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

95
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,156
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

96
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,792
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

97
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,459
then by the system,

98
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,030
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

99
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,765
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

100
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,201
"Rejected by city."

101
00:07:14,235 --> 00:07:16,170
That's the <i>Tribune.</i>
Nobody reads the <i>Tribune.</i>

102
00:07:16,203 --> 00:07:18,973
-I do.
-Anyway, okay, well, um...

103
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,776
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

104
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:26,247
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

105
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:28,716
-Hostage situation?
-Yeah.

106
00:07:37,291 --> 00:07:39,060
I suck balls at this.

107
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:42,663
Why do we always have
to play war games?

108
00:07:42,697 --> 00:07:44,497
Hey, it's practice
for our other job.

109
00:07:44,532 --> 00:07:46,267
I'm serious.

110
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,636
Military strategy,
multiple team members,

111
00:07:48,669 --> 00:07:50,504
each with a special skillset

112
00:07:50,538 --> 00:07:52,807
unleashed against
an unknown enemy.

113
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:54,542
I know how it sounds,

114
00:07:54,575 --> 00:07:56,177
but the house keeps getting
struck by lightning, Leo.

115
00:07:56,210 --> 00:07:57,979
I'm telling you.

116
00:07:58,012 --> 00:07:59,814
Besides, you're the one
always talking about teamwork.

117
00:07:59,847 --> 00:08:02,249
But we don't need guns!

118
00:08:02,283 --> 00:08:04,118
Darla?

119
00:08:04,151 --> 00:08:05,286
This is it.
This is big time.

120
00:08:05,319 --> 00:08:07,955
- We are the guns.
- Darla!

121
00:08:07,989 --> 00:08:09,523
Why were there Skittles
in my pockets?

122
00:08:09,557 --> 00:08:11,659
It was supposed
to be a surprise.

123
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:13,160
It was.

124
00:08:13,194 --> 00:08:14,962
Hmm, she's very moody lately.

125
00:08:14,996 --> 00:08:16,964
Why do you think
I put Skittles in her pocket?

126
00:08:16,998 --> 00:08:19,166
- Oh.
- Whoo! <i>Ole.</i>

127
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:20,601
Is this an army
of unicorns

128
00:08:20,634 --> 00:08:22,236
-killing Genghis Khan?
-Yes.

129
00:08:22,269 --> 00:08:24,005
Unicorns aren't real.

130
00:08:24,038 --> 00:08:26,173
It's called speculative
history, Eugene. Look it up.

131
00:08:26,207 --> 00:08:27,241
Billy,
you can't just leave.

132
00:08:27,274 --> 00:08:29,043
Your guy's gonna die!

133
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:30,878
Whoo!

134
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:34,682
-See?
-Yes.

135
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,983
I told you
you would get into it

136
00:08:36,017 --> 00:08:37,551
if you gave it a chance.

137
00:08:37,585 --> 00:08:39,787
Yeah, I'm really starting
to see the appeal.

138
00:08:42,156 --> 00:08:43,591
What's going on?

139
00:08:51,966 --> 00:08:53,768
Dude, what are you doing?

140
00:08:53,801 --> 00:08:55,269
<i>Possible 10-99 in progress.</i>

141
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,871
<i>Multiple reports of cracking</i>
<i>on roadway.</i>

142
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:58,806
<i>Fraying suspension cables.</i>

143
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:01,042
<i>All units</i>
<i>to the Ben Franklin Bridge.</i>

144
00:09:01,075 --> 00:09:03,144
Yeah.
It's crazy music, Freddy.

145
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:05,613
It is, isn't it?
Very urgent melody to it.

146
00:09:05,646 --> 00:09:06,747
We should see it
performed live.

147
00:09:06,781 --> 00:09:08,149
I was thinking the same thing.

148
00:09:08,182 --> 00:09:09,650
I feel like we can get tickets
to that concert.

149
00:09:09,683 --> 00:09:11,585
Two. Maybe not six.

150
00:09:11,619 --> 00:09:13,754
All or none. That's the rule.

151
00:09:13,788 --> 00:09:16,624
Yet I'm still gonna
walk backwards now.

152
00:09:16,657 --> 00:09:19,093
So, now's your last
and final chance.

153
00:09:19,126 --> 00:09:20,995
Billy Batson, come with me.

154
00:09:21,028 --> 00:09:22,763
No, no, no!

155
00:09:22,797 --> 00:09:25,766
Man, it sure is a beautiful
day in Philadelphia!

156
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:28,069
Is it though?

157
00:09:28,102 --> 00:09:29,970
-Almost finished.
-Again?

158
00:09:30,004 --> 00:09:32,206
- Okay.
- This better be good.

159
00:09:34,408 --> 00:09:37,044
Whoa, whoa!
Where's everyone going?

160
00:09:37,078 --> 00:09:38,746
Um...

161
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:39,814
To fight crime?

162
00:09:41,649 --> 00:09:43,951
-Okay.
-Bye, Mom.

163
00:09:43,984 --> 00:09:45,352
-Bye, Mom.
-Bye, Mom.

164
00:09:45,386 --> 00:09:47,588
-Bye.
-Bye, Rosa.

165
00:09:50,091 --> 00:09:51,125
Give it time.

166
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:00,835
You guys ready?

167
00:10:02,269 --> 00:10:03,304
Shazam!

168
00:10:28,129 --> 00:10:29,230
Oh, my God.

169
00:10:30,931 --> 00:10:32,299
It's gonna break!

170
00:10:34,969 --> 00:10:36,003
Run!

171
00:10:49,116 --> 00:10:51,285
<i>♪ I need a hero ♪</i>

172
00:10:51,318 --> 00:10:55,422
<i>♪ I'm holding out for a hero</i>
<i>Till the end of the night ♪</i>

173
00:10:55,456 --> 00:10:56,657
<i>♪ He's... ♪</i>

174
00:11:43,137 --> 00:11:44,872
No, no, no.

175
00:11:52,179 --> 00:11:54,748
No way, shut up!
Did I just save you

176
00:11:54,782 --> 00:11:56,150
while you were listening
to this song?

177
00:11:58,419 --> 00:11:59,920
No! I got you, I got you.

178
00:12:13,133 --> 00:12:16,203
No need to panic.
Captain Everypower is here.

179
00:12:16,237 --> 00:12:17,938
Oh.

180
00:12:22,176 --> 00:12:24,011
I'm just kidding,
it's real easy.

181
00:12:34,088 --> 00:12:35,122
Hi!

182
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:39,393
Oh, my gosh. Kittens!

183
00:12:39,426 --> 00:12:43,097
Oh! They're so cute!

184
00:12:46,033 --> 00:12:47,268
Did she just leave us?

185
00:12:48,269 --> 00:12:50,871
Okay, let's go.

186
00:13:33,581 --> 00:13:35,517
-Okay.
-No, no, no, I got ya!

187
00:13:35,550 --> 00:13:39,320
That's my sidekick.
Captain Everypower Junior.

188
00:13:39,353 --> 00:13:41,155
Hey! Junior?

189
00:13:41,188 --> 00:13:42,524
You're gonna
wanna hold on tight.

190
00:14:03,645 --> 00:14:04,945
Everyone's safe.

191
00:14:04,978 --> 00:14:05,979
Awesome job, Mary.

192
00:14:06,614 --> 00:14:08,349
Circle up, fam!

193
00:14:14,221 --> 00:14:16,658
All right,
here's the situation.

194
00:14:16,691 --> 00:14:19,293
We have one more job to do

195
00:14:19,326 --> 00:14:21,495
and that's to keep this bridge
from collapsing.

196
00:14:23,364 --> 00:14:25,667
<i>The Ben Franklin</i>
<i>Bridge has collapsed.</i>

197
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,401
<i>Fortunately, there are</i>
<i>no casualties.</i>

198
00:14:27,434 --> 00:14:29,169
<i>Thanks in part</i>
<i>to our local heroes,</i>

199
00:14:29,203 --> 00:14:30,572
<i>one with me now.</i>

200
00:14:30,605 --> 00:14:32,239
<i>It's great to be here, Nancy.</i>

201
00:14:32,272 --> 00:14:35,409
<i>What can I say?</i>
<i>It's all in a day's work.</i>

202
00:14:35,442 --> 00:14:37,144
<i>Right. Well, how do you feel</i>
<i>about being dubbed</i>

203
00:14:37,177 --> 00:14:39,246
<i>the Philadelphia Fiascoes?</i>

204
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:41,248
<i>Given that that's not</i>
<i>an official title,</i>

205
00:14:41,281 --> 00:14:43,217
<i>we feel nothing about it.</i>
<i>That is not our name.</i>

206
00:14:43,250 --> 00:14:44,686
<i>Right, but</i>
<i>the important thing is...</i>

207
00:14:44,719 --> 00:14:46,621
What is wrong
with these people?

208
00:14:48,155 --> 00:14:50,324
Have you ever no...

209
00:14:50,357 --> 00:14:52,393
I'm gonna go check
on the kids.

210
00:14:52,426 --> 00:14:54,228
Yeah, you should.
 God only knows what they're up to.

211
00:14:54,261 --> 00:14:56,063
Probably drugs, right?
Probably taking selfies

212
00:14:56,096 --> 00:14:57,297
while vaping on TikTok.

213
00:14:57,331 --> 00:14:58,365
Oh.

214
00:15:02,035 --> 00:15:03,070
Is that a kitten?

215
00:15:04,438 --> 00:15:05,439
No.

216
00:15:33,200 --> 00:15:34,636
I'm gonna name you Tawny.

217
00:15:49,216 --> 00:15:52,654
"Destroy bridge"?
What?

218
00:15:52,687 --> 00:15:55,489
Not saving is different
than breaking. Am I wrong?

219
00:15:55,523 --> 00:15:58,358
Am I wrong about this? Also,
we saved countless lives.

220
00:15:58,392 --> 00:16:01,295
A hundred sixty-two.
It's countable.

221
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,297
Emotionally countless,

222
00:16:03,330 --> 00:16:04,331
Mary.

223
00:16:05,700 --> 00:16:07,000
Where's Eugene?

224
00:16:07,034 --> 00:16:08,335
Where he always is.

225
00:16:08,368 --> 00:16:11,004
Mapping out the Room of Doors.

226
00:16:15,108 --> 00:16:16,511
Eugene!

227
00:16:16,544 --> 00:16:19,112
Hey, buddy! Where you at?

228
00:16:21,583 --> 00:16:23,083
Hey, Eugene.

229
00:16:25,419 --> 00:16:28,422
Hello? We have a meeting,
Eugene.

230
00:16:34,428 --> 00:16:35,429
Oh.

231
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:39,066
You're late.

232
00:16:39,801 --> 00:16:41,001
Do not go in there.

233
00:16:44,171 --> 00:16:46,340
All right, fam-jam,
let's jump in.

234
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,078
All right, big day,

235
00:16:51,111 --> 00:16:53,748
big bridge,
kind of a couple blunders,
right?

236
00:16:53,781 --> 00:16:55,683
But we're gonna meditate
on those mistakes right now.

237
00:16:58,418 --> 00:16:59,419
Mary?

238
00:17:01,321 --> 00:17:03,090
Organic chem is my meditation.

239
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:06,426
Said nobody with friends ever,
really.

240
00:17:06,460 --> 00:17:09,129
In point of fact,
I'd have friends

241
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:10,565
if I had gone to college.

242
00:17:10,598 --> 00:17:12,399
In point of fact
is exactly the kind of

243
00:17:12,432 --> 00:17:13,668
smart thing
that a smart person

244
00:17:13,701 --> 00:17:15,135
who doesn't need
to go to college says.

245
00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,604
So,

246
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,171
let's go back to the tape.

247
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,774
Now, guys, as you can see,

248
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:22,644
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

249
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,445
Right up top, all that
cohesiveness, energy,

250
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,214
terrific!

251
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,384
Oh, sorry, Coach.
Gotta fly IRL.

252
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,719
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

253
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,420
I know. And I love
these daily recaps.

254
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,690
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

255
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,792
-It helps keep me loose!
-Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

256
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,326
We'll go have a group hang
in the air. That sounds great.

257
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,862
I gotta test this slime
for toxicity

258
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,230
'cause I'm starting to...
tingle.

259
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,233
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game
just came on

260
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,269
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

261
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,405
It's right that I give
Tawny back.

262
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,709
Oh, come on!
What is happening?

263
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,778
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

264
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,245
If you say you have to work...

265
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,647
I have to work.

266
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,816
Why do you even have a job?

267
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,216
Wonder Woman
doesn't have a job!

268
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,652
-Stop.
-No, seriously.

269
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,820
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

270
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,454
and, like, nobody
recognizes her

271
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,823
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

272
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,458
Just stop.
You are holding on too tight.

273
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,294
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

274
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,698
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

275
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,633
Or me wanting to go to college

276
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,267
means I'm abandoning
the family.

277
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,703
Oh. Okay, cool,

278
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,671
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

279
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:24,839
Yeah.

280
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,674
Do you really
not see yourself?

281
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,482
You turn 18 in five months.

282
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,752
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

283
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,387
Victor and Rosa
are saints, yes,
but you're about to age out

284
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,322
of the foster system
just like I did.

285
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,926
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

286
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,760
Do you?

287
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,897
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

288
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,834
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

289
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,902
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

290
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,674
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

291
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,408
I want to contribute.

292
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,310
At some point, Billy, like

293
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,580
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

294
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,381
leave home.

295
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,789
Nothing lasts forever.

296
00:19:23,463 --> 00:19:26,734
I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

297
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:33,206
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

298
00:20:08,475 --> 00:20:10,912
Leave me to die.

299
00:20:10,945 --> 00:20:14,381
Oh, but we come bearing gifts.

300
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:26,594
Magic.

301
00:20:26,627 --> 00:20:28,495
Impossible.

302
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,698
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

303
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:35,435
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

304
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:38,271
From every god in this realm.

305
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,674
From me.

306
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,746
Do you not remember
what you took?

307
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,715
What my particular power was?

308
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,317
The power of elements.

309
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,855
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

310
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,857
from entering the human realm.

311
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,059
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if--

312
00:20:58,092 --> 00:20:59,627
Someone broke this?

313
00:21:01,495 --> 00:21:02,797
How did...

314
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:04,565
Where is the Champion?

315
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,367
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

316
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,670
and yours that will mend it.

317
00:21:09,704 --> 00:21:12,840
I told you
I would die before I help you.

318
00:21:31,526 --> 00:21:34,361
Now, say the word.

319
00:21:34,394 --> 00:21:36,564
Never. Never!

320
00:21:36,597 --> 00:21:38,065
Never say never.

321
00:21:45,573 --> 00:21:47,374
Say the word.

322
00:21:54,949 --> 00:21:57,685
<i>Say the word. Say the word.</i>

323
00:21:57,718 --> 00:22:00,121
Shazam!

324
00:22:30,685 --> 00:22:32,987
Now we get to have our fun.

325
00:22:33,020 --> 00:22:37,457
Fun is for children, dear.
We are at war.

326
00:22:56,644 --> 00:22:57,812
-Oh, my gosh.
-Oh, my goodness.

327
00:22:57,845 --> 00:22:58,880
-I am so sorry!
-I'm so sorry!

328
00:22:58,913 --> 00:23:00,447
No, don't be sorry. I'm sorry!

329
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:01,549
No, it's totally my fault.
Are you okay?

330
00:23:01,582 --> 00:23:02,583
-I'm okay, yeah.
-Okay, yeah.

331
00:23:02,617 --> 00:23:04,151
-I'm always okay.
-Good.

332
00:23:04,185 --> 00:23:07,655
Uh, actually, do you...
do you know where this is?

333
00:23:07,688 --> 00:23:08,823
Miss Saunders!

334
00:23:08,856 --> 00:23:11,125
Yeah, absolutely

335
00:23:11,158 --> 00:23:12,793
is what I meant to say.
Voice crack. It's weird.

336
00:23:12,827 --> 00:23:14,562
Oh, no, no worries. If it
makes you feel any better

337
00:23:14,595 --> 00:23:15,763
it's nothing compared
to the amount

338
00:23:15,796 --> 00:23:16,998
that you're blushing
right now.

339
00:23:17,031 --> 00:23:18,498
Oh, I blush
when I'm confident.

340
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,934
There she is.

341
00:23:19,967 --> 00:23:22,103
-Hey.
-New girl. First period.

342
00:23:22,136 --> 00:23:24,505
- Yeah.
- I'm Brett. This is Burke.

343
00:23:24,538 --> 00:23:26,140
Listen, if you need anything
at all,

344
00:23:26,173 --> 00:23:28,075
we're your guys. We got it.

345
00:23:28,109 --> 00:23:30,144
Brett
and Burke Breyer.

346
00:23:30,177 --> 00:23:31,612
They got it all. I mean,
what is it, narcissistic
personality disorder,

347
00:23:31,646 --> 00:23:33,514
chlamydia, they got it.

348
00:23:33,547 --> 00:23:35,482
Plenty of it
to go around, too.

349
00:23:35,516 --> 00:23:38,152
This is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid.

350
00:23:38,185 --> 00:23:40,087
Fanboy here thinks
he's a big boy now.

351
00:23:40,121 --> 00:23:41,656
Yeah, he doesn't know
where he belongs.

352
00:23:41,689 --> 00:23:43,157
Sure I do. I don't belong
in that trash can.

353
00:23:43,190 --> 00:23:44,859
'Cause that's... I'll smell
like human garbage,

354
00:23:44,892 --> 00:23:46,827
do you realize that?
And that's your brand, guys!

355
00:23:48,763 --> 00:23:50,097
Down goes Freeman.

356
00:23:50,131 --> 00:23:51,464
Hey, hey! Look!

357
00:23:52,700 --> 00:23:55,102
-Now I'm a superhero.
-Nice!

358
00:23:57,772 --> 00:23:59,674
What is this thing doing here?

359
00:23:59,707 --> 00:24:01,075
Janitors.

360
00:24:01,108 --> 00:24:02,209
Get up, man.
What are you doin'?

361
00:24:02,243 --> 00:24:03,744
Come on.

362
00:24:03,778 --> 00:24:05,046
You're gonna want
to get this fixed, huh?

363
00:24:05,079 --> 00:24:07,048
Yeah, that's probably
why you fell.

364
00:24:07,081 --> 00:24:08,716
- Yeah.
- Bye, new girl.

365
00:24:08,749 --> 00:24:09,884
Jeez, thanks Mr. Geckle.

366
00:24:09,917 --> 00:24:11,585
Don't sweat it. That trash can

367
00:24:11,619 --> 00:24:13,120
was like a second home to me
when I went here.

368
00:24:15,723 --> 00:24:17,058
Hey.

369
00:24:17,091 --> 00:24:18,759
You knew those guys
were gonna hit you,

370
00:24:18,793 --> 00:24:20,695
but you stepped in anyway.

371
00:24:20,728 --> 00:24:22,863
You know something?
That's how I amuse myself.

372
00:24:22,897 --> 00:24:24,098
The funnier I am,

373
00:24:24,131 --> 00:24:26,867
the more
I get punched.

374
00:24:28,135 --> 00:24:29,603
Well, it made me laugh.

375
00:24:30,671 --> 00:24:31,772
So...

376
00:24:36,110 --> 00:24:37,678
Hero.

377
00:24:41,849 --> 00:24:44,018
You gonna walk me to class,
or what?

378
00:24:44,051 --> 00:24:45,286
Why would I...
Walk you to class? No.

379
00:24:45,319 --> 00:24:47,621
Why would I wanna do that?
Yes!

380
00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,956
Thanks.

381
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,258
So, from the top.

382
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,628
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

383
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:58,699
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

384
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,102
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

385
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,104
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

386
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:06,140
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

387
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,675
-That was you?
-Yeah.

388
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,310
And they're still dicks
to you?

389
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,878
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

390
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,247
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

391
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,749
You seem pretty cool to me.

392
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:18,586
Freddy!

393
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,956
Is my name.

394
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,792
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

395
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,293
he said in a normal voice.

396
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,528
I'm Anne.

397
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,798
Anne.

398
00:25:32,066 --> 00:25:33,267
-Nice!
-Bullseye.

399
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,002
Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

400
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,005
What?

401
00:26:13,707 --> 00:26:17,378
Good, little one.
Well done.

402
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,314
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

403
00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,667
Wow. Um...

404
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,403
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

405
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,339
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

406
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,741
Romantic setting

407
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:50,144
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

408
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,779
I mean, you went all out.

409
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,882
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

410
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,650
I'm just not sure

411
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,652
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

412
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,155
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

413
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:05,793
I promise this is
not about you. Okay?
Look...

414
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,761
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

415
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,263
You and me.

416
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,933
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies.

417
00:27:13,734 --> 00:27:16,070
She-zam.

418
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:18,372
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

419
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,841
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

420
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:23,377
That I'm gonna let you down.

421
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,718
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

422
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,919
Let's try this crazy thing.

423
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,155
Maybe we'll, uh...

424
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,392
seal it with a kiss?

425
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,474
Billy Batson!

426
00:27:53,508 --> 00:27:55,910
You are a fool of a champion.

427
00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,012
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

428
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:59,280
What happened
to her beautiful face?

429
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,048
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

430
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,250
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

431
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,252
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

432
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,453
Daughters of Atlas?

433
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,055
They're coming to unmake
your world

434
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,025
and torture mankind
for all eternity

435
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,827
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

436
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:14,929
I should be writing
all this down.

437
00:28:14,962 --> 00:28:16,096
-Quiet!
-Okay, okay.

438
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,098
You don't know
what you've done.

439
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,134
I regret ever choosing you.

440
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,902
Because of you,

441
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,938
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

442
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,406
They will be hunting
for you now.

443
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,440
Hunting your family.

444
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,011
Hmm?

445
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,948
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

446
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:36,317
The fate of your world
depends on it.

447
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,786
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

448
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,021
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

449
00:29:01,442 --> 00:29:03,077
Hey, Freddy?

450
00:29:14,054 --> 00:29:17,791
Nope, over it.
Done it.

451
00:29:17,825 --> 00:29:20,060
Check fraud? What,
are you kidding me?

452
00:29:20,961 --> 00:29:22,796
Armored car heist?

453
00:29:22,830 --> 00:29:25,065
I think I got that
in the bag.

454
00:29:27,001 --> 00:29:28,836
Shazam!

455
00:29:34,341 --> 00:29:35,342
Whoo!

456
00:29:38,946 --> 00:29:40,147
Bon appetit.

457
00:29:41,516 --> 00:29:43,017
Hi.

458
00:29:43,050 --> 00:29:45,553
- Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
- Hi.

459
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,087
Um, you wanna show me

460
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,989
where you were sitting
when it happened?

461
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,560
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

462
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,428
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay, yeah.

463
00:29:54,461 --> 00:29:56,864
So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

464
00:30:00,901 --> 00:30:02,403
So I was sitting, yeah...

465
00:30:02,436 --> 00:30:04,972
Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

466
00:30:05,005 --> 00:30:06,240
right there.

467
00:30:06,273 --> 00:30:07,441
- Here?
- Right there, yeah.

468
00:30:09,476 --> 00:30:11,145
Oh, sorry.
Overbearing brother.

469
00:30:11,178 --> 00:30:13,213
Oh, I have one of those.
Uh, a sister.

470
00:30:13,247 --> 00:30:14,415
Always has to know where I am.

471
00:30:14,448 --> 00:30:15,883
Right.

472
00:30:15,916 --> 00:30:17,184
I feel that, clearly.

473
00:30:17,217 --> 00:30:18,886
Always thinks she knows
better, too.

474
00:30:18,919 --> 00:30:20,321
Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

475
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:22,222
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

476
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,425
No, of course. It'd just be
nice not to have someone--

477
00:30:24,458 --> 00:30:26,327
Constantly breathing
down your neck.

478
00:30:26,360 --> 00:30:28,195
-From the moment you wake up!
-'Cause I'm not a kid anymore.

479
00:30:28,228 --> 00:30:30,565
No! I'm a month younger,
one month exactly.

480
00:30:30,598 --> 00:30:32,366
And do we have to do
every single thing together?

481
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,468
No!

482
00:30:36,571 --> 00:30:38,872
Oh! Billy! What...

483
00:30:38,906 --> 00:30:40,274
What a coinkidink! Um...

484
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,276
I was just telling
my friend Anne

485
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,179
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

486
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,648
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

487
00:30:46,681 --> 00:30:48,516
-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

488
00:30:48,550 --> 00:30:50,951
-I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.

489
00:30:52,587 --> 00:30:54,888
Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

490
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,123
The skin peeled off his face.

491
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,025
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

492
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,160
-Yeah, seems definitive.
-I dunno.

493
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:03,330
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

494
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,932
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

495
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,534
Could be
astral projection powers.

496
00:31:06,568 --> 00:31:08,969
-What's that?
-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

497
00:31:09,002 --> 00:31:10,605
-from the great beyond?
-That's it, I'm calling

498
00:31:10,638 --> 00:31:12,239
an emergency meeting
after school.

499
00:31:12,272 --> 00:31:14,274
-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

500
00:31:14,308 --> 00:31:15,577
-What?
-Dude.

501
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:20,147
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

502
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,616
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

503
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,183
What is that, the <i>Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

504
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,619
Freddy, we only have one rule.

505
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,120
All or none.

506
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,421
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

507
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,156
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

508
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,024
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

509
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,993
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

510
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,562
but I'll never find out

511
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,029
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

512
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,398
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

513
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:40,467
Okay. Mmm.

514
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,670
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

515
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,271
Total control freak.

516
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:45,673
I think you guys
would get along.

517
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,575
Think you'd love her,
actually.

518
00:31:47,609 --> 00:31:48,942
<i>Look, look, look. Fam,</i>

519
00:31:48,976 --> 00:31:50,377
I know it sounds crazy.

520
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,146
And, and obviously
I don't know

521
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,148
exactly what this all means

522
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,683
but, but he was super aggro

523
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,719
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

524
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,353
He was yelling about all this

525
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,954
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

526
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,490
Do you have to talk so loud?

527
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,492
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

528
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:08,328
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable
indoor voice volume.

529
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:09,697
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

530
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,966
-Yeah.
-Why do you have
sunglasses on?

531
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,301
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

532
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,640
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

533
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:21,475
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

534
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,512
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

535
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,481
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

536
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,751
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

537
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,385
No, she...

538
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,020
Yeah, can we get back
on track?

539
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,522
Listen, he's yelling at me

540
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,524
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

541
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,492
are coming to hunt us.

542
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:40,027
So, check out what I found.

543
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,529
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

544
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,764
of the Titan Atlas..."

545
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,398
which is obvious,

546
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:48,570
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

547
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:51,104
Well, good things
can happen at night.

548
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,640
And death.

549
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,509
Let me see this.

550
00:32:59,547 --> 00:33:02,550
"The daughters
guard the mythic Tree of Life

551
00:33:02,584 --> 00:33:06,320
which grows golden apples
that contain the seeds of life

552
00:33:06,353 --> 00:33:08,288
which gave birth
to their realm

553
00:33:08,322 --> 00:33:09,657
protected by a...

554
00:33:10,658 --> 00:33:12,760
-dragon."
-Hey, now.

555
00:33:12,794 --> 00:33:14,127
And I am suddenly here
for this.

556
00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,597
I know, right?

557
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,097
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

558
00:33:17,130 --> 00:33:18,800
-On the other hand, dragon!
-Dragon!

559
00:33:18,833 --> 00:33:20,568
Mary. What are we doin'?

560
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,403
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

561
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:26,073
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

562
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,675
and, and, and look,

563
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,545
I often think that you think
better than me.

564
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:34,314
The wizard
did not exactly give me
a tutorial here, guys, okay?

565
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,383
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

566
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,452
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

567
00:33:38,485 --> 00:33:41,188
that is, like,
constantly burning
which is super weird but also

568
00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:42,624
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

569
00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,693
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

570
00:33:45,727 --> 00:33:48,161
And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

571
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:50,364
But I really,
really need your help.

572
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:55,369
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

573
00:34:00,440 --> 00:34:02,476
Shut up. That lights up?

574
00:34:04,546 --> 00:34:06,548
Shut up.

575
00:34:39,514 --> 00:34:41,415
So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

576
00:34:41,448 --> 00:34:43,183
and you withhold this?

577
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:43,851
And you have really
been holding out on us.

578
00:34:43,885 --> 00:34:44,852
Jeez Louise, dude.

579
00:34:47,354 --> 00:34:49,423
- Whoa!
- "Whoa" what?

580
00:34:49,456 --> 00:34:51,158
- "Whoa" what?
- Look!

581
00:34:51,191 --> 00:34:52,492
Hey, Steve.

582
00:34:53,795 --> 00:34:56,296
What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

583
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,832
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

584
00:34:57,865 --> 00:34:59,567
He totally
looks like a "Steve."

585
00:35:01,636 --> 00:35:05,205
-"'Crime and Punishment,'
a book report by Pedro Pena?"
-Yeah.

586
00:35:05,238 --> 00:35:07,575
Pedro.

587
00:35:07,609 --> 00:35:10,545
-Dude, that's cheating.
-I mean, he knows everything.

588
00:35:10,578 --> 00:35:13,146
-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

589
00:35:13,180 --> 00:35:14,549
You can just ask him stuff?

590
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:16,149
- Pretty much.
- Slick. Okay, cool.

591
00:35:16,183 --> 00:35:18,720
Steve, we're looking
for information

592
00:35:18,753 --> 00:35:20,755
about the daughters of Atlas.

593
00:35:20,788 --> 00:35:22,790
Can you please help us
with that?

594
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,199
- These are book titles.
- Okay.

595
00:35:32,232 --> 00:35:33,601
Let's just all pick a book,
or something.

596
00:35:33,635 --> 00:35:36,169
Where's Freddy?
I mean, obscure mythology?

597
00:35:36,203 --> 00:35:37,805
Definitely his thing.

598
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,508
I'm not even sure Freddy knows
what his thing is anymore.

599
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:48,549
You know I've actually never,
never been up here.

600
00:35:48,583 --> 00:35:50,885
Don't lie.
This is where you hang out

601
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:53,353
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

602
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,623
No, actually, why would
they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

603
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,391
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

604
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:59,326
Do you actually know
those guys?

605
00:35:59,359 --> 00:36:02,429
Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend"
situation?

606
00:36:02,462 --> 00:36:03,665
Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

607
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:05,399
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

608
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:09,737
Do you wanna meet one of them?

609
00:36:10,538 --> 00:36:11,673
Meet, like how?

610
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,206
Like, face-to-face, right now.

611
00:36:14,341 --> 00:36:15,610
I'm gonna take that as a yes.

612
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,878
And today is your lucky day,

613
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,846
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

614
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,314
Her?

615
00:36:21,348 --> 00:36:22,784
-No, the male hot one.
-Him?

616
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,687
What? Him?

617
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,588
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

618
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,691
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

619
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,559
so... It's no big deal.

620
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:33,561
Is this a joke, Freddy?

621
00:36:33,594 --> 00:36:36,396
'Cause I didn't mean
to make you
actually prove it, really.

622
00:36:39,801 --> 00:36:41,569
No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

623
00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,403
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

624
00:36:43,437 --> 00:36:46,541
So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

625
00:36:46,574 --> 00:36:48,576
Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

626
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:51,411
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

627
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:52,580
Remember that time
I saved your life?

628
00:36:52,613 --> 00:36:53,715
No, no, no, the other time.

629
00:36:53,748 --> 00:36:55,315
Yeah.

630
00:36:55,348 --> 00:36:57,685
Well, I'm calling in
that favor.

631
00:37:06,728 --> 00:37:08,361
You must be Anne.

632
00:37:08,395 --> 00:37:10,998
Oh, my God.

633
00:37:12,466 --> 00:37:14,035
Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

634
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,938
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

635
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,877
You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

636
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,011
but that kid,

637
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,646
he's the real hero.

638
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,749
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

639
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,483
I've never met anyone
like him.

640
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,786
He's... genuine

641
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,589
and warm and funny.

642
00:37:34,622 --> 00:37:36,323
-That's a lot of nice things.
-Yeah.

643
00:37:38,059 --> 00:37:39,560
How did you two meet?

644
00:37:39,594 --> 00:37:40,695
Comic Con.

645
00:37:40,728 --> 00:37:42,697
-What's Comic Con?
-What?

646
00:37:42,730 --> 00:37:43,965
<i>According to this,</i>

647
00:37:43,998 --> 00:37:46,433
gods considered
humans servants,

648
00:37:46,466 --> 00:37:48,368
toys to be played with,

649
00:37:48,401 --> 00:37:49,737
children to be punished.

650
00:37:51,706 --> 00:37:53,440
Thanks, Steve.

651
00:37:53,473 --> 00:37:55,877
Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

652
00:37:55,910 --> 00:37:57,578
I'm reading about that
right now.

653
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,312
So, apparently, all of this

654
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,414
revolves around
a powerful weapon.

655
00:38:01,448 --> 00:38:03,416
So Atlas, uh, the father

656
00:38:03,450 --> 00:38:05,653
of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

657
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:07,555
he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

658
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:10,091
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

659
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,027
but also to take powers away
from others.

660
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,664
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

661
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:20,535
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

662
00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:22,036
But when things got bad,

663
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:25,039
a council of human wizards
got together and they

664
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,574
stole the staff from Atlas.

665
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,441
And they used that to take
his powers away.

666
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,844
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

667
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,444
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

668
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,380
this is the wizard
that I know!

669
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,549
What do these say?

670
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,488
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

671
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,057
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

672
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,792
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

673
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,094
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

674
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,530
No.

675
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,633
Whoa, guys, look!

676
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,135
This is what the name means.

677
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,736
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

678
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,738
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

679
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,908
If I may point out one
of the powers
that may be possibly MIA.

680
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,543
Boop.

681
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,644
I'm sorry,

682
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,546
are you very unsubtly implying

683
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,115
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

684
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,017
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

685
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,820
Well, maybe it comes later.

686
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:14,822
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

687
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:15,890
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

688
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,390
This is very, very hurtful.

689
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:18,559
I just want you all
to know that.

690
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:19,961
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

691
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:21,529
Oh.

692
00:39:21,562 --> 00:39:23,130
What else
have we learned, fam?

693
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:27,702
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

694
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:32,006
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

695
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,108
magical sphere

696
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,010
sealing it away forever.

697
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,411
Cut off from magic.

698
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,514
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

699
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:43,651
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

700
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,922
<i>A bizarre and gruesome scene</i>
<i>unfolded</i>

701
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,757
<i>in Athens, Greece</i>
<i>this morning.</i>

702
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,826
<i>Two women dressed in what</i>
<i>appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

703
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the wizard's staff.
How did they get that?

704
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,763
So, all those statues
used to be people.

705
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:59,767
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

706
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,902
where Greece is at?

707
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:06,040
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

708
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,108
You want it back?

709
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:13,080
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

710
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,549
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

711
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,717
-You know?
-What?

712
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,085
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

713
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,787
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

714
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,923
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

715
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:23,724
You're welcome, by the way.

716
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:24,992
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

717
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,061
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

718
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,729
You broke the staff,

719
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,665
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

720
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:31,899
Which we now know.

721
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,868
We also now know
what they look like,

722
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,703
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

723
00:40:35,736 --> 00:40:36,771
-coming a--
-Three.

724
00:40:36,804 --> 00:40:37,805
What?

725
00:40:39,607 --> 00:40:41,474
Atlas had three daughters.

726
00:40:41,509 --> 00:40:43,778
Kalypso, Hespera,

727
00:40:44,545 --> 00:40:45,646
Anthea.

728
00:40:45,680 --> 00:40:48,082
Anne... thea.

729
00:40:50,618 --> 00:40:53,187
You know, I'm not
just a superhero.

730
00:40:54,155 --> 00:40:55,623
I'm a super listener.

731
00:40:56,624 --> 00:40:57,925
And...

732
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,093
I sense...

733
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:03,030
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

734
00:41:03,064 --> 00:41:04,966
Just wanna know
when he's coming back.

735
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:07,601
Don't want him to get hurt.

736
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:10,638
Oh, well, Anne...
I mean, we can't choose

737
00:41:10,671 --> 00:41:12,239
the people we fall for.

738
00:41:12,273 --> 00:41:13,941
What?

739
00:41:13,975 --> 00:41:15,710
I'm not talking about that.

740
00:41:15,743 --> 00:41:18,579
If he shows up now,
he's in serious danger.

741
00:41:18,612 --> 00:41:20,681
Whoa! Look who you're with.

742
00:41:20,715 --> 00:41:22,216
What could possibly
be dangerous?

743
00:41:22,249 --> 00:41:23,250
Us.

744
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:27,188
Okay.

745
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:28,923
I see how it is.

746
00:41:28,956 --> 00:41:29,957
Let's dance.

747
00:41:33,094 --> 00:41:34,628
Oh, my God.

748
00:41:34,662 --> 00:41:35,663
Freddy?

749
00:41:36,163 --> 00:41:37,198
Ow!

750
00:41:37,231 --> 00:41:38,833
Oh, Freddy, I, I didn't know.

751
00:41:38,866 --> 00:41:40,234
I never meant
for you to get hurt.

752
00:41:40,267 --> 00:41:42,169
Oh, I'm not the one
who's gonna get hurt.

753
00:41:43,004 --> 00:41:44,005
Shazam!

754
00:41:45,706 --> 00:41:46,707
Shazam!

755
00:41:47,608 --> 00:41:48,843
Shazam.

756
00:41:48,876 --> 00:41:50,911
- What's going on up here?
- Mis...

757
00:41:50,945 --> 00:41:52,713
Freddy, are you all right?

758
00:41:52,747 --> 00:41:53,714
Get back inside.
Just get back inside,
Mr. Geckle.

759
00:41:53,748 --> 00:41:55,916
I'm okay. Go back inside.

760
00:41:55,950 --> 00:41:57,318
Who are you?
Do you have kids here?

761
00:41:57,351 --> 00:41:58,819
What are you doing?
Don't hurt him.

762
00:41:58,853 --> 00:42:01,522
I won't touch him.
You have my word.

763
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:13,167
Mr. G. Wha...

764
00:42:13,200 --> 00:42:14,635
What did she say?
What are you doing?

765
00:42:16,337 --> 00:42:18,072
What are you doing?

766
00:42:18,105 --> 00:42:19,840
What are you...
no, no, no!

767
00:42:19,874 --> 00:42:21,008
Stop, stop, stop! Wait,
wait, wait! Hey, no, no, no!

768
00:42:21,042 --> 00:42:24,612
Wait, no, no, no!

769
00:42:28,215 --> 00:42:30,017
I forgot how easily
they burst.

770
00:42:30,051 --> 00:42:31,185
Why would you do that?

771
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:33,187
Like grapes.

772
00:42:37,291 --> 00:42:38,292
What the... Huh?

773
00:42:50,271 --> 00:42:53,707
Now, child, tell us where
to find the others.

774
00:42:53,741 --> 00:42:55,276
No need.

775
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:02,116
Clip his wings, Anthea.

776
00:43:30,878 --> 00:43:31,879
Ow.

777
00:43:37,718 --> 00:43:38,719
Wait.

778
00:43:40,754 --> 00:43:41,789
There are more.

779
00:43:47,428 --> 00:43:50,731
-Perfect. We take them all.
-No.

780
00:43:50,764 --> 00:43:52,233
That's not why we're here.

781
00:43:52,266 --> 00:43:54,401
We're here for the seed
of life. Yield, sister.

782
00:43:54,435 --> 00:43:56,270
We stick to the plan we have.

783
00:43:56,303 --> 00:43:57,404
Father would never yield.

784
00:43:57,438 --> 00:43:59,073
And Father is dead.

785
00:43:59,106 --> 00:44:01,809
Now, you know your place,
sister.

786
00:44:01,842 --> 00:44:03,344
Or I will show it to you.

787
00:44:05,479 --> 00:44:07,815
We do this our way,
not theirs.

788
00:44:15,055 --> 00:44:17,358
Make one move...

789
00:44:21,228 --> 00:44:23,764
...and I will snap
this child's neck.

790
00:44:52,159 --> 00:44:53,761
Oh, Freddy.

791
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,769
Billy, no!

792
00:45:36,804 --> 00:45:38,205
Billy, stay back!

793
00:45:38,239 --> 00:45:39,473
They're using the staff
to take our powers.

794
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:51,151
What? What?

795
00:46:06,867 --> 00:46:07,868
Sorry!

796
00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,839
I'm sorry,

797
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:13,240
I'm sorry, just,
just save yourself.

798
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,943
No, no, all or none.
We stick together.

799
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:18,879
And that you will
because you cannot leave.

800
00:46:18,912 --> 00:46:22,249
Let's see how you like being
sealed off in a dying world.

801
00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,985
No!

802
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,120
No!

803
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,154
Freddy!

804
00:46:35,429 --> 00:46:37,264
<i>From</i>
<i>City Line Avenue in the north</i>

805
00:46:37,298 --> 00:46:39,300
<i>to the western shore</i>
<i>of the Schuylkill River</i>

806
00:46:39,333 --> 00:46:40,602
<i>to Cobbs Creek.</i>

807
00:46:40,635 --> 00:46:42,537
<i>The unidentified barrier</i>
<i>appears</i>

808
00:46:42,570 --> 00:46:44,238
<i>to be in the shape of a dome</i>

809
00:46:44,271 --> 00:46:47,341
<i>with no one allowed</i>
<i>into the city or out</i>

810
00:46:47,374 --> 00:46:51,245
<i>with some suggesting</i>
<i>this strange magical element</i>

811
00:46:51,278 --> 00:46:56,250
<i>may be the doing, or undoing,</i>
<i>of the Philadelphia Fiascoes.</i>

812
00:47:15,235 --> 00:47:16,538
- Holy sh...
- Shh!

813
00:47:16,571 --> 00:47:20,174
I'm trying to sleep.

814
00:47:20,207 --> 00:47:22,510
It is the only escape
from the tortures here.

815
00:47:22,544 --> 00:47:24,878
Okay. Bleak.

816
00:47:26,447 --> 00:47:28,248
Wait a second.

817
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:30,451
Hagrid beard, Batman voice.

818
00:47:30,484 --> 00:47:33,153
You're the wizard.
You're the wizard! Oh, my...

819
00:47:33,187 --> 00:47:34,556
You're back! Billy told me
all about you.

820
00:47:34,589 --> 00:47:36,890
Billy? You know Billy Batson?

821
00:47:36,924 --> 00:47:38,359
Billy Batson. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

822
00:47:38,392 --> 00:47:40,327
I'm... I'm Freddy Freeman,
Captain Everypower.

823
00:47:40,361 --> 00:47:42,262
Well, used to be.
It's complicated now.

824
00:47:42,296 --> 00:47:43,964
She... It's complicated.

825
00:47:43,997 --> 00:47:46,400
That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

826
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:49,470
Yeah, he did. And he said
that you turned into ash,
but, but didn't?

827
00:47:51,438 --> 00:47:52,940
Once I gave him the power,

828
00:47:52,973 --> 00:47:55,543
I could no longer remain
in my realm.

829
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,311
But death would have
been a luxury

830
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,313
compared to being trapped
in this cell

831
00:47:59,346 --> 00:48:01,683
with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

832
00:48:01,716 --> 00:48:03,183
Mostly with you.

833
00:48:03,217 --> 00:48:04,351
A little more sarcastic
than Billy said,

834
00:48:04,385 --> 00:48:06,220
but, hey, all good.

835
00:48:06,253 --> 00:48:08,355
-Let's just get out of here.
-"Let's just get out of here."

836
00:48:08,389 --> 00:48:09,591
Yeah, sure.

837
00:48:09,624 --> 00:48:11,392
I sound nothing like that,
but okay.

838
00:48:11,425 --> 00:48:12,926
Here's what we've got, um...

839
00:48:12,960 --> 00:48:15,295
A cranky wizard
with a cynical streak

840
00:48:15,329 --> 00:48:18,232
and a precocious young man
with an encyclopedic knowledge
regarding magical shit.

841
00:48:18,265 --> 00:48:22,269
There is no way these sisters
are keeping us in here.

842
00:48:22,302 --> 00:48:24,138
These prison bars,
they're probably enchanted!

843
00:48:24,171 --> 00:48:27,274
-What spells do you know?
-Please, stop talking.

844
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,442
How about an arcane focus?

845
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,144
I don't even know
what that is.

846
00:48:31,478 --> 00:48:33,213
Fine, then let's make
a potion.

847
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,382
Like a potion of, um, giant
strength or diminution.

848
00:48:35,416 --> 00:48:37,184
Oh! Gaseous form!

849
00:48:37,217 --> 00:48:39,621
Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

850
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:43,157
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

851
00:48:44,191 --> 00:48:45,993
We will die here, Freeby.

852
00:48:46,026 --> 00:48:48,962
It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

853
00:48:48,996 --> 00:48:50,364
The sooner you accept it,

854
00:48:51,265 --> 00:48:52,466
the easier it will be.

855
00:48:52,499 --> 00:48:55,169
Is this a tooth?
There's a tooth in here!

856
00:48:55,703 --> 00:48:56,738
Hmm.

857
00:49:05,312 --> 00:49:08,315
"Power
of elements. Power of chaos.

858
00:49:08,348 --> 00:49:10,451
Power of axis."

859
00:49:10,484 --> 00:49:12,119
These are primordial forces.

860
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,054
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

861
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,989
I tell you how we fight it.

862
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,424
With the wisdom of...

863
00:49:18,292 --> 00:49:20,562
-Solomon.
-Exactly.

864
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:22,463
We, we set up a meeting.

865
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:25,032
Yeah, we tell 'em we want
to negotiate.

866
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:27,201
Offer up our powers
for Freddy.

867
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,136
But then we grab one of them

868
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,004
and that's what we really use
to trade!

869
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,507
But what if they steal
our powers?

870
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,676
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

871
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:37,344
You know what I mean?
If they just point
that staff at us, we dodge.

872
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:40,080
Like dodgeball.

873
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:42,282
-Hmm.
-Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

874
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,318
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodgeball,

875
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:45,687
but not Super Pedro.

876
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,088
No, Super Pedro also sucks
at dodgeball.

877
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:51,124
Fine. Listen, all I know
is that there's five of us
and three of them.

878
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:53,427
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

879
00:49:55,830 --> 00:49:57,130
Okay.

880
00:49:57,164 --> 00:49:59,199
So, Steve says that this paper

881
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:01,368
is a stack
of magical parchment.

882
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,337
You write a message
on the magical paper

883
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,340
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

884
00:50:06,373 --> 00:50:08,810
and then the paper folds
into a...

885
00:50:08,843 --> 00:50:11,378
Oh, my God, yes!

886
00:50:12,647 --> 00:50:14,248
A paper bird.

887
00:50:14,281 --> 00:50:15,783
And it flies to the god.

888
00:50:15,817 --> 00:50:17,685
Well,
that's kinda cute.

889
00:50:17,719 --> 00:50:21,789
Hey, what about demigods? Uh,
you know, like, Wonder Woman?

890
00:50:21,823 --> 00:50:24,224
Do you think she's accepting
bird letters right now?

891
00:50:26,360 --> 00:50:27,494
Did the pen just shrug?

892
00:50:28,830 --> 00:50:30,598
Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

893
00:50:31,733 --> 00:50:33,701
I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

894
00:50:33,735 --> 00:50:35,068
All right.

895
00:50:36,336 --> 00:50:38,305
Letter...

896
00:50:38,338 --> 00:50:42,276
Letter, writing a letter.
No, no, no!

897
00:50:42,309 --> 00:50:43,811
I was just talking out loud.

898
00:50:43,845 --> 00:50:45,145
That's not a part
of the letter.
Wad that up, too.

899
00:50:46,514 --> 00:50:48,550
Maybe if you try

900
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,652
-speaking from the heart.
-Hmm.

901
00:50:50,685 --> 00:50:52,554
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

902
00:50:53,655 --> 00:50:55,690
violence is not the answer."

903
00:51:17,712 --> 00:51:19,313
Child,

904
00:51:19,346 --> 00:51:21,381
I will spare your life
if you're honest with me.

905
00:51:21,415 --> 00:51:22,784
Honesty.

906
00:51:22,817 --> 00:51:26,521
Yeah, wow, very, um,
ironic subject choice.

907
00:51:27,421 --> 00:51:28,623
The other Champions...

908
00:51:28,656 --> 00:51:31,158
are they children
like yourself?

909
00:51:31,191 --> 00:51:32,860
What even is a child?

910
00:51:32,894 --> 00:51:35,730
I mean, I know I shave,
like, every week-ish.

911
00:51:35,763 --> 00:51:37,497
Yes or no?

912
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,667
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

913
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:43,337
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

914
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,741
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

915
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:50,912
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer,
and, uh, Burke Breyer.

916
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:52,446
Are you guys taking
this stuff in?

917
00:51:52,479 --> 00:51:53,848
Writing this down? No?

918
00:51:53,881 --> 00:51:55,248
They drive a Dodge Ram.

919
00:51:55,282 --> 00:51:56,450
He's lying.

920
00:51:56,483 --> 00:51:58,886
That's your superpower,
not mine.

921
00:51:58,920 --> 00:52:00,722
And she thinks
you're a total control freak.

922
00:52:01,823 --> 00:52:02,924
One of you.

923
00:52:02,957 --> 00:52:04,224
Probably you.

924
00:52:05,258 --> 00:52:07,427
Hold him.

925
00:52:09,530 --> 00:52:11,733
Don't...
What's happening?

926
00:52:11,766 --> 00:52:13,200
What is that?
What's she doing?

927
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:14,636
Power of chaos.

928
00:52:14,669 --> 00:52:17,170
It enters a man's mind
and shatters it whole.

929
00:52:17,204 --> 00:52:19,707
Oh.
My mind is already trash,

930
00:52:19,741 --> 00:52:22,175
so I'd actually like
to see you try.

931
00:52:22,209 --> 00:52:24,344
Because nobody has the balls

932
00:52:24,378 --> 00:52:26,480
to handle what's
inside my brain.

933
00:52:26,514 --> 00:52:28,683
Say their names.

934
00:52:34,956 --> 00:52:36,824
Say their names.

935
00:52:36,858 --> 00:52:39,727
<i>Say their names.</i>
<i>Say their names.</i>

936
00:52:43,665 --> 00:52:46,734
Destiny's Child did it better.

937
00:52:46,768 --> 00:52:48,268
He is stronger than he looks.

938
00:52:50,437 --> 00:52:52,305
-Say their names.
-Stop!

939
00:52:54,776 --> 00:52:55,877
Billy...

940
00:52:59,413 --> 00:53:00,848
Billy Bats...

941
00:53:04,719 --> 00:53:06,253
Billy B...

942
00:53:06,286 --> 00:53:07,689
Stop.

943
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:11,826
This is from the Champions.

944
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,295
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

945
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:17,699
violence is not the answer.

946
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:21,501
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

947
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:23,303
-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

948
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,772
We'll give up our powers

949
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:28,241
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

950
00:53:28,275 --> 00:53:31,311
Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

951
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:32,680
Smart, Eugene.

952
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:34,982
Steve, add 'unharmed'

953
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,484
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

954
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:40,320
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

955
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:43,290
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

956
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,892
Should we proofread it?

957
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:47,294
Naw, Steve doesn't
make mistakes,

958
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,663
just writes what you say.

959
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:52,033
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

960
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:55,002
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

961
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:56,436
Do we have red?"

962
00:53:57,572 --> 00:53:59,941
What is this Gatorade?

963
00:54:02,810 --> 00:54:04,779
-Is it a weapon?
-Sister.

964
00:54:04,812 --> 00:54:07,782
We need not torture him
any longer.
You heard the letter.

965
00:54:09,617 --> 00:54:11,418
- Throw them in the pit.
- Wait.

966
00:54:12,419 --> 00:54:13,855
They want to make a trade.

967
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,059
And we will meet, sister.

968
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,861
But humans are not
to be trusted.

969
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:23,598
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

970
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:26,399
Right?

971
00:54:44,685 --> 00:54:46,053
Are you hurt?

972
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:48,723
No, just worthless.

973
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:51,324
-Well, you must get up.
-For what?

974
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,029
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

975
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:57,031
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

976
00:54:57,064 --> 00:54:58,866
Oh, feelings.

977
00:55:13,514 --> 00:55:16,383
-I see something moving.
-Yeah, I see it, too.

978
00:55:32,967 --> 00:55:33,968
Oh, shit.

979
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,537
What is that?

980
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,839
Ladon.

981
00:55:37,872 --> 00:55:40,074
The guardian
of the Garden of Atlas.

982
00:55:49,851 --> 00:55:52,553
-Run.
-I can't. I can't!

983
00:56:10,738 --> 00:56:12,773
You're okay! You're okay.

984
00:56:12,807 --> 00:56:14,542
I don't feel okay at all.

985
00:56:14,575 --> 00:56:17,011
That's the power
of the dragon.

986
00:56:17,044 --> 00:56:19,412
It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

987
00:56:19,446 --> 00:56:21,716
Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

988
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:23,918
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

989
00:56:25,152 --> 00:56:27,655
Power of axis. Very cool, very,

990
00:56:27,688 --> 00:56:29,590
- very rare.
- Anthea!

991
00:56:29,624 --> 00:56:31,626
I must go.

992
00:56:31,659 --> 00:56:34,595
The door back to your world
is at the center
of the labyrinth.

993
00:56:34,629 --> 00:56:36,463
Right, left, left

994
00:56:36,496 --> 00:56:38,933
and then follow
the right-hand wall
to the center.

995
00:56:38,966 --> 00:56:40,768
-You'll need this.
-How did you find this?

996
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:42,469
You once protected me
from the bullies

997
00:56:42,502 --> 00:56:44,572
in your world, Freddy Freeman.

998
00:56:44,605 --> 00:56:45,806
Now I've protected you
in mine.

999
00:56:50,912 --> 00:56:53,147
Hero.

1000
00:56:53,180 --> 00:56:56,483
Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

1001
00:56:56,517 --> 00:56:58,019
I was about to rearrange
those boys'

1002
00:56:58,052 --> 00:56:59,720
internal organs
when you stepped in.

1003
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:02,455
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1004
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:05,192
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1005
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:08,930
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

1006
00:57:10,932 --> 00:57:13,668
How lovely
for both of you.

1007
00:57:13,701 --> 00:57:15,970
Goddess, we thank you much,
but we must get--

1008
00:57:16,003 --> 00:57:18,806
You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

1009
00:57:18,839 --> 00:57:20,440
All they require now
is the seed.

1010
00:57:21,242 --> 00:57:23,511
-The seed?
-Yes.

1011
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:25,212
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1012
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,248
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

1013
00:57:27,281 --> 00:57:29,850
You call me Jeff?
She just said my entire name!

1014
00:57:43,130 --> 00:57:44,999
Hi, God... No?

1015
00:57:48,135 --> 00:57:50,204
Yo, Low Voltage.

1016
00:57:52,073 --> 00:57:53,941
When you fixing
this dome shit, man?

1017
00:57:53,975 --> 00:57:55,543
Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1018
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,844
I have a plan.

1019
00:57:56,877 --> 00:57:58,245
-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1020
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,047
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1021
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,515
No, these sandwiches?

1022
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:02,650
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1023
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:04,051
They're, they're
for a meeting.

1024
00:58:04,085 --> 00:58:07,521
Yeah, sure,
Colonel Cheesesteak.

1025
00:58:08,022 --> 00:58:09,023
Colonel?

1026
00:58:10,257 --> 00:58:11,926
Oh, boy, I really need a name.

1027
00:58:16,097 --> 00:58:17,932
Quiet one, she is.

1028
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:20,634
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1029
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,738
Is that...

1030
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,639
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1031
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:27,208
Uh...

1032
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,111
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

1033
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:31,979
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1034
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,281
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1035
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,251
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1036
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,287
like, really personally
and, like, I don't even
know you, lady, right?

1037
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:42,890
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1038
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:45,026
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1039
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,528
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1040
00:58:48,863 --> 00:58:50,564
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1041
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:51,966
dropped the money
on the ground

1042
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,635
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1043
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,639
Now, imagine it is not money,

1044
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:00,875
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1045
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,943
The last breath
of your mother.

1046
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,279
The power of all the gods,

1047
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:08,716
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1048
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:11,252
And now this magic courses
through you,

1049
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:13,154
and you have the gall

1050
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:15,790
to believe
that you deserve it?

1051
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,194
This is very personal,

1052
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,596
Billy.

1053
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:27,368
You are very menacing.

1054
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,804
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1055
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:33,374
I see the presence
that you have,
and that goes a long way.

1056
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:37,044
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1057
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:39,013
There is no compromise.

1058
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:41,015
I knew you were gonna
say that.

1059
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,317
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1060
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,986
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

1061
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,190
sphere-y dome-y
magic bowl thing

1062
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,891
and then, you know,

1063
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:52,626
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1064
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,861
It's a good offer.

1065
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,029
I'm being serious.

1066
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:57,765
You play the part of a man,

1067
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:00,134
but you do not play it well.

1068
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,603
Give us the powers, child.

1069
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,972
All of them.

1070
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,841
You are no leader, Billy.

1071
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:09,777
You are a lost boy

1072
01:00:09,810 --> 01:00:13,013
who likes to make-believe
that he's a warrior.

1073
01:00:13,047 --> 01:00:15,216
Okay, look. I might not have
as much experience as you

1074
01:00:15,249 --> 01:00:17,251
'cause I'm not, like,
super old like you,

1075
01:00:17,284 --> 01:00:20,688
but I think I have
a few experiences
that you don't have.

1076
01:00:20,721 --> 01:00:23,958
'Cause I've seen all of the
<i>Fast and the Furious</i> movies,
lady.

1077
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:25,693
And let me tell you something.

1078
01:00:25,726 --> 01:00:28,796
It's all about family!

1079
01:00:34,135 --> 01:00:36,303
Family!

1080
01:00:36,337 --> 01:00:39,673
Guys, that was the signal.
We practiced this,
like, 12 times. Thank you.

1081
01:00:39,707 --> 01:00:41,742
Forgot all about my family,
didn't you, Goddess?

1082
01:00:42,943 --> 01:00:45,913
No, human.
You forgot about mine.

1083
01:00:56,323 --> 01:00:57,358
Come on!

1084
01:00:57,391 --> 01:00:58,425
-Let's go.
-Pedro!

1085
01:01:34,061 --> 01:01:36,830
You're wasting my time, boy.

1086
01:02:15,502 --> 01:02:17,004
Yeah.

1087
01:02:17,037 --> 01:02:18,239
Whoo!

1088
01:02:18,272 --> 01:02:20,007
She sure didn't see
that coming

1089
01:02:20,040 --> 01:02:23,978
because she didn't go
to the eye doctor.

1090
01:02:24,011 --> 01:02:25,813
Uh, Darla,
that was, 'cause...

1091
01:02:25,846 --> 01:02:28,249
- A euphemism.
That was a euphemism.

1092
01:02:35,122 --> 01:02:37,157
No!

1093
01:02:50,070 --> 01:02:51,338
We've taken the power
from two

1094
01:02:51,372 --> 01:02:53,240
in your family already.

1095
01:02:53,274 --> 01:02:55,909
And now two more must die,
and for what?

1096
01:02:55,943 --> 01:02:58,345
So you can keep
playing soldier?

1097
01:03:34,549 --> 01:03:37,051
My father was Atlas.

1098
01:03:37,084 --> 01:03:39,987
Titan god of stamina
and strength.

1099
01:03:42,389 --> 01:03:45,359
His magic and power
may course through you,

1100
01:03:45,392 --> 01:03:48,862
but you will never
be a true god.

1101
01:03:48,896 --> 01:03:50,898
Oh, yeah? Did your dad
have superspeed?

1102
01:03:55,169 --> 01:03:57,471
Nope!

1103
01:04:02,677 --> 01:04:05,879
You okay? That was fun.
Let's go.

1104
01:04:10,184 --> 01:04:11,852
Come on. Come on, come on.

1105
01:04:14,421 --> 01:04:16,056
Hurry, everyone!

1106
01:04:16,090 --> 01:04:17,091
Let's go, let's go.

1107
01:04:27,034 --> 01:04:28,636
What?

1108
01:04:30,572 --> 01:04:32,106
You thought you were
just goin'

1109
01:04:32,139 --> 01:04:33,474
into some regular porta-potty,
didn't ya?

1110
01:04:33,508 --> 01:04:35,677
Which I can somehow
still smell.

1111
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:38,011
Yeah, yeah, it really sticks
around. It's crazy, right?

1112
01:04:38,045 --> 01:04:39,179
-Yeah.
-Like, permeates

1113
01:04:39,213 --> 01:04:40,682
the air.
Doesn't matter. Anyway,

1114
01:04:40,715 --> 01:04:42,249
welcome to the Rock
of Eternity.

1115
01:04:43,117 --> 01:04:44,485
Only Champions

1116
01:04:44,519 --> 01:04:47,054
can get in here,
through any door that we want.

1117
01:04:47,087 --> 01:04:49,691
Little thing that we can do
that your sisters can't.

1118
01:04:49,724 --> 01:04:52,359
Guys, that's what I call
a total success.

1119
01:04:53,695 --> 01:04:55,697
Okay, maybe, like,
a partial total win.

1120
01:04:55,730 --> 01:04:57,632
- Told you I suck at dodgeball.
- Yeah,

1121
01:04:57,665 --> 01:04:59,233
you do, yeah, but you know,

1122
01:04:59,266 --> 01:05:00,535
look, Pedro, we all have
our weak spots.

1123
01:05:00,568 --> 01:05:02,035
You know what I mean?

1124
01:05:02,069 --> 01:05:03,605
And hers...

1125
01:05:03,638 --> 01:05:05,305
lack of strategic thinking.

1126
01:05:05,339 --> 01:05:07,274
Now for the real trade.

1127
01:05:07,307 --> 01:05:10,612
Freddy and the staff,
for your freedom.

1128
01:05:10,645 --> 01:05:12,179
And get rid
of the dome.

1129
01:05:12,212 --> 01:05:13,313
Oh, yeah.

1130
01:05:13,347 --> 01:05:15,482
And get rid of the dome.

1131
01:05:15,517 --> 01:05:17,184
'Cause the city
of brotherly love

1132
01:05:17,217 --> 01:05:18,385
is gettin' a little moist.

1133
01:05:20,722 --> 01:05:22,256
Word choice, man.

1134
01:05:22,289 --> 01:05:23,323
Yeah, I regretted it
as soon as

1135
01:05:23,357 --> 01:05:25,092
it was coming out of my mouth.

1136
01:05:25,125 --> 01:05:26,093
It's just
one of those words...

1137
01:05:26,126 --> 01:05:26,628
I know. I just...

1138
01:05:31,398 --> 01:05:34,101
"Dear daughters
of Asshat-Las."

1139
01:05:34,134 --> 01:05:35,703
Burn!

1140
01:05:35,737 --> 01:05:37,171
I just came up with that.

1141
01:05:37,204 --> 01:05:38,372
Make sure you put a dash
in there, though,

1142
01:05:38,405 --> 01:05:40,340
so it's really clear. Okay.

1143
01:05:40,374 --> 01:05:42,677
Man, it's so good having
Steve cover grammar

1144
01:05:42,710 --> 01:05:45,112
and spelling and stuff,
it makes me sound
so much smarter.

1145
01:05:46,046 --> 01:05:47,981
So...

1146
01:05:48,015 --> 01:05:50,017
"A brother for a sister, huh?

1147
01:05:50,050 --> 01:05:51,586
How's that feel?

1148
01:05:51,619 --> 01:05:54,488
Also, how are you
actually sisters,

1149
01:05:54,522 --> 01:05:57,324
because the age difference
is very noticeable,

1150
01:05:57,357 --> 01:06:00,562
and slightly upsetting,
I'm not gonna lie."

1151
01:06:00,595 --> 01:06:03,096
Even though I don't like you
very much,

1152
01:06:03,130 --> 01:06:05,065
I believe everyone
deserves human rights,

1153
01:06:05,098 --> 01:06:06,701
but you don't deserve
strawberry.

1154
01:06:06,734 --> 01:06:09,637
You only get yellow.

1155
01:06:12,139 --> 01:06:13,140
She's gone!

1156
01:06:14,709 --> 01:06:15,777
Wait, what?

1157
01:06:26,688 --> 01:06:28,556
I thought we brought her in
too easily.

1158
01:06:28,590 --> 01:06:30,625
She wanted to get caught.

1159
01:06:30,658 --> 01:06:34,194
I don't get it.
Where would she even go?

1160
01:06:43,337 --> 01:06:45,673
Well, this seemed inevitable.

1161
01:06:52,312 --> 01:06:55,148
Yep. We are so lost.
Thanks, bozo.

1162
01:06:55,182 --> 01:06:58,285
We are not lost.
Who's the wizard here?

1163
01:06:58,318 --> 01:06:59,787
I don't know.

1164
01:06:59,821 --> 01:07:02,289
You don't have any spells,
no magical artifacts,

1165
01:07:02,322 --> 01:07:04,324
you know nothing about magic,
you're just...

1166
01:07:07,795 --> 01:07:09,096
You're the wizard.

1167
01:07:09,129 --> 01:07:11,298
-Thank you.
-Whatever.

1168
01:07:11,331 --> 01:07:14,101
Now let's see if that
girlfriend of yours
can be trusted.

1169
01:07:29,283 --> 01:07:31,519
Get back, get back. Get back.

1170
01:07:59,747 --> 01:08:01,381
Okay, I think the coast is clear.
 Let's go home.

1171
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,717
One moment.

1172
01:08:02,750 --> 01:08:05,252
Did you not see
what she was holding?

1173
01:08:05,285 --> 01:08:06,854
It was an apple.
She wanted a snack.

1174
01:08:06,888 --> 01:08:08,355
What's the big deal?

1175
01:08:08,388 --> 01:08:11,626
The golden apple.
From the Tree of Life.

1176
01:08:11,659 --> 01:08:13,493
From the Tree of Life.

1177
01:08:13,528 --> 01:08:15,262
Oh, wait, hold up, didn't you
say that was somewhere safe?

1178
01:08:17,665 --> 01:08:20,233
-Billy!
-Billy. Gosh.

1179
01:08:22,770 --> 01:08:23,771
Where are you going now?

1180
01:08:30,945 --> 01:08:33,681
Nope.

1181
01:08:33,715 --> 01:08:34,716
She's not in there.

1182
01:08:35,783 --> 01:08:37,184
Nope.

1183
01:08:37,217 --> 01:08:38,753
No, no, no.
That's a hard pass.

1184
01:08:38,786 --> 01:08:40,788
- That's a hard pass.
- Yo, Billy,

1185
01:08:40,822 --> 01:08:42,422
you don't gotta worry
about that one.

1186
01:08:42,456 --> 01:08:44,191
It's just a labyrinth
that doesn't go anywhere.

1187
01:08:44,224 --> 01:08:45,793
Like an ancient Greek

1188
01:08:45,827 --> 01:08:46,861
- labyrinth?
- Guys...

1189
01:08:47,895 --> 01:08:50,297
porta-potty.

1190
01:08:50,330 --> 01:08:51,899
Mmm.

1191
01:09:01,308 --> 01:09:02,376
Hespera.

1192
01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:10,384
It's over, sisters.

1193
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,854
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1194
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:17,659
Or we plant it in their realm.

1195
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:21,194
But that would destroy
their world.

1196
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,497
Just as they destroyed ours.

1197
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,667
You can't be serious.

1198
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,568
- Yes.
- No.

1199
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,202
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1200
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:30,805
Anthea,
you simpering bore.

1201
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,507
She's right,
we've spent ages

1202
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,941
waiting for this moment.

1203
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:35,475
We have the seed.

1204
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,444
We have the staff
and its powers.

1205
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:38,813
We are not squandering it

1206
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,715
for your personal
satisfaction.

1207
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:43,751
No, I should go, not you.

1208
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:45,787
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1209
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,221
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly
sing "sneak thief."

1210
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:50,558
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1211
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:51,826
It's pathetic.

1212
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,927
See?

1213
01:09:53,995 --> 01:09:55,530
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1214
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:57,665
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1215
01:09:58,599 --> 01:10:01,334
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1216
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,706
That's it.
You nailed it.

1217
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,406
I'll see you
on the other side.

1218
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,342
Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

1219
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,945
would not thrive
in their soil.

1220
01:10:10,978 --> 01:10:14,281
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1221
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:15,616
Monstrous?

1222
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,985
That is what humans are.

1223
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,988
It is only fitting
that we bring
our monsters to their world

1224
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:23,624
and do to them
as they did to us.

1225
01:10:26,694 --> 01:10:28,863
We agreed
to restore balance

1226
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:32,499
and vengeance has
great measure of weight
on those scales.

1227
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:35,570
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1228
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:37,538
-No, not all.
-All.

1229
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:40,975
Sister,
I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.

1230
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:42,375
Why?

1231
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,712
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1232
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:46,881
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1233
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:49,382
They actually pray
for order and peace

1234
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:52,553
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1235
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:54,789
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1236
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,924
and plant it in our garden.

1237
01:10:58,425 --> 01:10:59,794
Of course
you turn to her.

1238
01:10:59,827 --> 01:11:01,596
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1239
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:05,332
Where did that even come from?

1240
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,770
-Hi!
-You favor her, Hespera,

1241
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,505
and see how she betrays us.

1242
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,676
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1243
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,845
- No!
- Kill him!

1244
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,017
What is that?

1245
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,919
Great question.
No idea.

1246
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,655
But made you look.

1247
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:28,856
Billy!

1248
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:32,492
-Oh!
-Oh.

1249
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,327
Your crutch!

1250
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:37,330
Oh! Shazam!

1251
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:38,365
-Yes!
-No!

1252
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,337
So, we have a lot
to talk about.

1253
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,651
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1254
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:00,054
You are not fit to wield it.

1255
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:01,589
More fit than you.

1256
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,356
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1257
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:06,694
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1258
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:08,796
but everyone here
has become weak.

1259
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:12,033
Ladon, world-eater,

1260
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:15,536
rise from the pit!

1261
01:12:24,111 --> 01:12:25,913
Go, go, go!

1262
01:12:25,947 --> 01:12:27,380
Captain Everypower!
Where's he going?

1263
01:12:27,414 --> 01:12:28,683
What the...

1264
01:12:44,165 --> 01:12:45,365
Victor?

1265
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Victor, wake up.

1266
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,738
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1267
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:52,439
Dad. We gotta go!

1268
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:54,575
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1269
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,811
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1270
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,613
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1271
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:00,413
Just don't freak out.

1272
01:13:05,519 --> 01:13:06,988
I said don't freak out!
Look at me, it's Billy.

1273
01:13:07,021 --> 01:13:08,756
Rosa, it's Billy, okay?
And that's Eugene,

1274
01:13:08,789 --> 01:13:10,024
-and that's Freddy...
-It's me.

1275
01:13:10,057 --> 01:13:11,491
That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

1276
01:13:11,525 --> 01:13:12,927
and then Pedro,
just normal Pedro.

1277
01:13:14,962 --> 01:13:16,097
Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1278
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,532
We have to tell 'em the truth.

1279
01:13:18,566 --> 01:13:20,902
- We're superheroes.
- I'm gay.

1280
01:13:20,935 --> 01:13:21,969
Yeah, we know, bud.

1281
01:13:23,137 --> 01:13:24,639
-You knew?
-Yeah.

1282
01:13:25,706 --> 01:13:27,875
-Yeah.
-Oh.

1283
01:13:27,909 --> 01:13:29,777
-I'm the wizard.
-Oh, this is the wizard.

1284
01:13:29,810 --> 01:13:31,444
He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

1285
01:13:31,478 --> 01:13:33,080
Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1286
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,148
Put on these clothes.

1287
01:13:34,181 --> 01:13:35,816
This is so weird.

1288
01:13:35,850 --> 01:13:37,051
Yep, yep.

1289
01:13:37,084 --> 01:13:39,787
You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1290
01:13:39,820 --> 01:13:43,090
Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1291
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,159
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

1292
01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:47,194
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

1293
01:13:47,995 --> 01:13:49,730
Dragon?

1294
01:14:26,701 --> 01:14:28,002
You okay?

1295
01:14:28,035 --> 01:14:29,036
Okay.

1296
01:14:30,237 --> 01:14:31,939
I know this is a lot
to take in,

1297
01:14:31,973 --> 01:14:33,941
but I promise
to explain it all later.

1298
01:14:33,975 --> 01:14:35,776
Explain what?

1299
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,545
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1300
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,113
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

1301
01:14:39,146 --> 01:14:41,515
-Yeah.
-Wait, you bought the house?

1302
01:14:41,549 --> 01:14:42,783
Yeah.

1303
01:14:49,790 --> 01:14:51,092
Run! Go!

1304
01:14:58,199 --> 01:15:00,835
Oh, no.

1305
01:15:03,604 --> 01:15:04,772
Get down.

1306
01:15:04,805 --> 01:15:06,207
Okay, that's it!

1307
01:15:07,274 --> 01:15:11,145
Again?

1308
01:15:11,178 --> 01:15:13,080
Freddy!

1309
01:15:16,684 --> 01:15:18,652
Hey, hey!
This is what you want, right?

1310
01:15:33,034 --> 01:15:34,635
Come on, we're good.

1311
01:15:34,668 --> 01:15:35,903
We're safe right now.
Let's go. Let's go.

1312
01:16:01,629 --> 01:16:02,630
Mary!

1313
01:16:03,831 --> 01:16:05,666
No.

1314
01:16:44,805 --> 01:16:47,007
Hey. Are you okay?

1315
01:16:47,775 --> 01:16:48,776
You okay?

1316
01:16:50,177 --> 01:16:51,178
All right.

1317
01:16:53,080 --> 01:16:54,849
Now, where is this dragon?

1318
01:17:22,109 --> 01:17:24,245
Fitting place for a garden.

1319
01:19:45,953 --> 01:19:47,354
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

1320
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,201
Go! Let's go, let's go!

1321
01:20:05,939 --> 01:20:08,842
Oh, God, I'm slipping!
Slipping!

1322
01:20:11,078 --> 01:20:12,980
My shoe!

1323
01:20:32,166 --> 01:20:34,201
Holy moly.

1324
01:20:54,021 --> 01:20:56,457
You know, I never thought
I'd say this about a dragon,

1325
01:20:56,490 --> 01:20:59,126
but it is the least
of our problems right now.

1326
01:21:02,463 --> 01:21:03,964
Your world will not
survive this.

1327
01:21:03,997 --> 01:21:05,199
Yeah, no shit, Merlin!

1328
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:06,266
He's right.

1329
01:21:07,401 --> 01:21:09,069
Anne!

1330
01:21:09,103 --> 01:21:11,539
-Are you okay? Are you hurt?
-I'm okay, I'm fine.

1331
01:21:12,940 --> 01:21:14,375
In the God Realm, this tree...

1332
01:21:15,442 --> 01:21:17,645
is a thing of beauty.

1333
01:21:17,679 --> 01:21:19,446
Of peace.

1334
01:21:19,480 --> 01:21:22,049
It was not meant
for the soil of this realm

1335
01:21:22,082 --> 01:21:24,218
and it's become monstrous
by the hand that planted it.

1336
01:21:24,251 --> 01:21:26,320
Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1337
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:28,455
I must try to sway Hespera.

1338
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,491
Only she can subdue
our sister.

1339
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:32,560
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1340
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:34,194
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1341
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,630
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1342
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:38,298
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1343
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:40,000
I've lived a long life.

1344
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:41,468
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1345
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:42,403
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1346
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:44,438
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1347
01:21:44,471 --> 01:21:46,039
Oh?

1348
01:21:47,441 --> 01:21:48,442
You look great.

1349
01:21:49,109 --> 01:21:50,110
Oh.

1350
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:57,151
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1351
01:21:57,184 --> 01:21:58,185
Yeah.

1352
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,462
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1353
01:22:08,495 --> 01:22:10,164
We have to figure
something out.

1354
01:22:11,365 --> 01:22:12,466
Take my powers back.

1355
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:14,001
-No, Billy!
-No, no, no.

1356
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:15,570
Hey, take my powers back.

1357
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,004
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1358
01:22:17,037 --> 01:22:19,206
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1359
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,374
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1360
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:22,142
but I really don't, okay?

1361
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:24,445
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1362
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:26,146
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1363
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,682
which means you know
what to do.

1364
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:29,717
And you were right.

1365
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:32,119
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1366
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:34,021
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1367
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:36,190
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1368
01:22:39,326 --> 01:22:41,563
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1369
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:42,730
No.

1370
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:44,364
You don't have
a shred of wisdom

1371
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:45,999
in that brain of yours.

1372
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:49,637
But your heart is wise.

1373
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:53,240
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1374
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:56,744
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1375
01:22:58,546 --> 01:23:00,481
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1376
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:03,116
with my brothers and sisters.

1377
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,752
But when you shared
your powers,

1378
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:07,622
you did not hesitate.

1379
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:10,123
For you, everyone
can be worthy

1380
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:11,593
if given a chance.

1381
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:15,128
Now, go fight for your family.

1382
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,331
Go fight for the world.

1383
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:19,567
I chose right
when I chose you.

1384
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:24,606
Billy?

1385
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,508
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1386
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:29,577
Same thing we
always do, Freddy.
Save the God darn world.

1387
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,378
Now, I'm gonna go
get that staff

1388
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:33,247
and I need you to lure
these things away

1389
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,083
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1390
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:37,752
Wait, wait, wait,
Billy, Billy.

1391
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,153
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1392
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:42,189
Not this version.

1393
01:23:42,222 --> 01:23:44,124
You... You.

1394
01:23:44,157 --> 01:23:45,259
My Billy.

1395
01:23:51,331 --> 01:23:52,432
Shazam!

1396
01:23:54,536 --> 01:23:57,137
Is that why the house keeps
getting struck by lightning?

1397
01:24:00,440 --> 01:24:01,441
Hey.

1398
01:24:08,550 --> 01:24:10,484
I promise after this

1399
01:24:10,518 --> 01:24:12,352
if I don't get eaten
by a dragon,

1400
01:24:13,821 --> 01:24:15,623
I'm not gonna force you
to keep me.

1401
01:24:15,657 --> 01:24:17,859
-Okay?
-What?

1402
01:24:17,892 --> 01:24:19,694
I know I age out soon.

1403
01:24:20,895 --> 01:24:22,630
Billy.

1404
01:24:22,664 --> 01:24:27,200
My wonderful, kind,
brave, son.

1405
01:24:27,234 --> 01:24:28,536
You will never age out
of your home.

1406
01:24:30,470 --> 01:24:31,573
Never.

1407
01:24:35,910 --> 01:24:38,245
Now, do me a favor

1408
01:24:38,278 --> 01:24:40,615
and I mean this
from the bottom of my heart,

1409
01:24:40,648 --> 01:24:43,216
go kick their ass, okay?

1410
01:24:44,451 --> 01:24:45,485
I love you, Mom.

1411
01:24:47,187 --> 01:24:48,188
Me too.

1412
01:24:49,924 --> 01:24:52,092
Shazam!

1413
01:24:57,297 --> 01:24:59,634
That's gonna take
some getting used to.

1414
01:24:59,667 --> 01:25:01,536
Everybody to the battle wagon!

1415
01:25:01,569 --> 01:25:02,804
The battle wagon?

1416
01:25:04,404 --> 01:25:05,773
Trying to get
into the spirit of things.

1417
01:25:23,558 --> 01:25:25,893
Don't you see what
you're doing to these people?

1418
01:25:25,927 --> 01:25:27,095
I do.

1419
01:25:27,929 --> 01:25:29,697
And what I see is just.

1420
01:25:29,731 --> 01:25:31,231
Hespera, look at this tree.

1421
01:25:31,264 --> 01:25:33,768
It is blighted.
It is unnatural here.

1422
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,703
We made a vow
to restore our realm,

1423
01:25:35,737 --> 01:25:37,437
not destroy another.

1424
01:25:37,471 --> 01:25:39,339
A god has answered
their prayers at last.

1425
01:25:39,373 --> 01:25:41,609
They did not know their place,

1426
01:25:41,643 --> 01:25:43,276
so I am showing it to them.

1427
01:25:43,310 --> 01:25:46,781
Your fanatical tone
echoes our uncle Hades.

1428
01:25:46,814 --> 01:25:48,850
No. I'm putting an end
to this.

1429
01:25:56,858 --> 01:25:59,192
Hespera.

1430
01:26:04,866 --> 01:26:06,166
No!

1431
01:26:07,300 --> 01:26:08,770
Hespera.

1432
01:26:08,803 --> 01:26:12,674
If your emotions rest
with the humans so, Anne,

1433
01:26:12,707 --> 01:26:15,175
then perhaps you should
be human.

1434
01:27:11,331 --> 01:27:13,634
Help, somebody!

1435
01:27:13,668 --> 01:27:14,936
Somebody help!

1436
01:27:14,969 --> 01:27:16,236
Somebody help!

1437
01:27:28,448 --> 01:27:30,017
Okay, now what? There are only
so many minotaurs

1438
01:27:30,051 --> 01:27:31,284
I can run over with this van.

1439
01:27:35,790 --> 01:27:36,791
Hey, Steve.

1440
01:27:38,559 --> 01:27:39,961
What are monsters afraid of?

1441
01:27:43,765 --> 01:27:44,932
"The king of beasts."

1442
01:27:44,966 --> 01:27:46,067
Lions?

1443
01:27:46,100 --> 01:27:47,400
Unicorns.

1444
01:27:47,434 --> 01:27:49,469
Really? I love unicorns.

1445
01:27:49,503 --> 01:27:51,506
Yet, the unicorn
does not love you.

1446
01:27:51,539 --> 01:27:53,541
Guys, unicorns don't exist.

1447
01:27:53,574 --> 01:27:55,475
What?

1448
01:27:57,477 --> 01:27:59,981
- Oh, my...
- Ah!

1449
01:28:00,014 --> 01:28:01,883
I guess maybe
it's not so crazy.

1450
01:28:01,916 --> 01:28:04,952
The unicorn is the most
fearsome creature
of its realm.

1451
01:28:04,986 --> 01:28:06,554
Ruthless and cruel,

1452
01:28:06,587 --> 01:28:07,822
not like the ponies
from your storybooks.

1453
01:28:07,855 --> 01:28:09,456
They loathe humanity.

1454
01:28:09,489 --> 01:28:10,958
Is there anything
they do like?

1455
01:28:12,527 --> 01:28:14,662
"Dark caverns. Ambrosia"?

1456
01:28:14,695 --> 01:28:16,329
Ambrosia. It's like the nectar
of the gods.

1457
01:28:16,363 --> 01:28:17,932
It's supposed to be sweet,
like honey.

1458
01:28:17,965 --> 01:28:19,366
I have an idea.

1459
01:28:19,399 --> 01:28:20,968
Go, go! Quick, quick.

1460
01:28:21,002 --> 01:28:23,738
Guys, get as many of these
people to safety as you can.

1461
01:28:24,504 --> 01:28:25,907
Kids?

1462
01:28:29,610 --> 01:28:31,679
-Let's go.
-Come on, let's go!

1463
01:28:32,613 --> 01:28:33,948
Wizard?

1464
01:28:33,981 --> 01:28:35,016
I'm going with them.

1465
01:28:35,883 --> 01:28:36,884
Freddy?

1466
01:28:39,153 --> 01:28:40,353
Anne?

1467
01:28:41,823 --> 01:28:42,990
Anne!

1468
01:28:43,024 --> 01:28:44,025
Anne!

1469
01:28:46,928 --> 01:28:49,897
I am not entirely sure
how to parent, here.

1470
01:28:57,672 --> 01:28:59,574
Hey! Khaleesi!

1471
01:29:12,687 --> 01:29:15,488
Whoo! That was
really satisfying.

1472
01:29:15,523 --> 01:29:16,524
How was that for you?

1473
01:29:33,808 --> 01:29:35,610
Yeah.

1474
01:29:35,643 --> 01:29:37,778
We love you, Thundercrack.

1475
01:29:37,812 --> 01:29:39,412
You're the best,
Captain Marvel.

1476
01:29:39,446 --> 01:29:42,049
-Yeah, go, High Voltage!
-Oh, wassup, bro?

1477
01:29:42,083 --> 01:29:44,417
It's Maximum Voltage actually,
amongst other names.

1478
01:29:44,451 --> 01:29:46,087
We're still kinda
workshopping it, so...

1479
01:29:53,127 --> 01:29:55,529
You thought you were
invulnerable.

1480
01:29:55,563 --> 01:29:57,198
But, no.

1481
01:29:57,231 --> 01:29:59,000
Magical fire.

1482
01:29:59,033 --> 01:30:00,935
Magic can kill magic.

1483
01:30:00,968 --> 01:30:02,770
Yeah, yeah, yeah,
"Magic kills magic."

1484
01:30:02,803 --> 01:30:04,437
Way ahead of you, lady.

1485
01:30:04,471 --> 01:30:05,506
I'm just trippin' out
because I've never seen

1486
01:30:05,539 --> 01:30:06,774
my suit burn like this.

1487
01:30:06,807 --> 01:30:09,210
Also, nobody messes
with my town!

1488
01:30:09,243 --> 01:30:11,145
Know what I'm saying?

1489
01:30:11,178 --> 01:30:13,547
I defeated
my traitor sister.

1490
01:30:13,581 --> 01:30:14,715
A god.

1491
01:30:14,749 --> 01:30:16,784
You think I won't destroy you?

1492
01:31:03,931 --> 01:31:05,599
The staff is absorbing it all.

1493
01:31:06,267 --> 01:31:07,467
Like a battery.

1494
01:31:13,774 --> 01:31:14,875
That's right.

1495
01:31:15,576 --> 01:31:17,144
Run!

1496
01:31:17,178 --> 01:31:18,846
This is a terrible idea.

1497
01:31:18,879 --> 01:31:21,048
You don't understand
the savagery, the barbarity.

1498
01:31:24,318 --> 01:31:25,586
Oh, no.

1499
01:31:54,749 --> 01:31:56,250
-Hello.
-No.

1500
01:32:00,021 --> 01:32:01,188
It's okay. Come here.

1501
01:32:06,093 --> 01:32:07,194
Darla...

1502
01:32:07,228 --> 01:32:09,697
It's okay. Good girl.

1503
01:32:17,238 --> 01:32:19,607
- Whoa, watch out!
- Whoa!

1504
01:32:19,640 --> 01:32:21,575
Darla!

1505
01:32:43,397 --> 01:32:44,799
Taste the rainbow.

1506
01:32:47,101 --> 01:32:48,302
Good, isn't it?

1507
01:32:48,335 --> 01:32:50,604
It's the closest to ambrosia
we have.

1508
01:33:15,396 --> 01:33:16,597
Good girl.

1509
01:33:23,370 --> 01:33:24,605
Whoa!

1510
01:33:33,914 --> 01:33:35,249
We're gonna need
more Skittles.

1511
01:34:12,253 --> 01:34:13,721
Taste the rainbow, motherfu...

1512
01:34:33,807 --> 01:34:35,943
No, no, no.

1513
01:34:35,976 --> 01:34:37,378
Lady, lady, you can't die!

1514
01:34:37,411 --> 01:34:39,446
Come on, Billy, come on!
Powers, powers, powers.

1515
01:34:39,480 --> 01:34:42,917
Medical powers. No.
How-to-fix-dead-people powers.

1516
01:34:50,391 --> 01:34:52,092
Clear?

1517
01:34:52,126 --> 01:34:55,129
Whoa! Come on!
One more time. Clear!

1518
01:34:55,162 --> 01:34:56,730
Stop! Stop!

1519
01:34:56,764 --> 01:34:59,099
Let me go to the Underworld
in peace, please.

1520
01:34:59,133 --> 01:35:02,136
Oh, lady, lady,
listen to me, okay?

1521
01:35:02,169 --> 01:35:03,470
I don't want anyone else
to die.

1522
01:35:03,504 --> 01:35:04,939
Not my family, not Anthea,
not anyone,

1523
01:35:04,972 --> 01:35:06,373
and we can save them.

1524
01:35:06,407 --> 01:35:07,942
This all came
from the tree, right?

1525
01:35:07,975 --> 01:35:09,443
I might know a way to destroy

1526
01:35:09,476 --> 01:35:11,011
the tree and the dragon
all in one.

1527
01:35:11,045 --> 01:35:14,381
Ladon's powers
are too great, boy.

1528
01:35:14,415 --> 01:35:16,050
Well, not if I can overload
the staff

1529
01:35:16,083 --> 01:35:18,352
-with enough lightning.
-A bomb?

1530
01:35:19,787 --> 01:35:20,955
Is that enough
to kill the dragon?

1531
01:35:20,988 --> 01:35:22,022
And more.

1532
01:35:23,924 --> 01:35:25,359
You would annihilate

1533
01:35:25,392 --> 01:35:27,461
everything that's inside
the dome.

1534
01:35:29,029 --> 01:35:30,965
Well, then I have
one more favor to ask.

1535
01:35:34,034 --> 01:35:35,936
Let's go, let's go.
Let's go.

1536
01:35:35,970 --> 01:35:37,137
There's shelter ahead.

1537
01:35:37,171 --> 01:35:39,406
There's shelter ahead.
Let's go.

1538
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:41,442
Walk, don't run.
There's shelter ahead.

1539
01:35:42,309 --> 01:35:43,310
Let's go, let's go.

1540
01:35:45,012 --> 01:35:46,780
Keep going. Keep going!

1541
01:35:46,814 --> 01:35:48,115
Anne!

1542
01:35:48,148 --> 01:35:49,149
Anne!

1543
01:35:50,150 --> 01:35:52,186
Anne!

1544
01:35:59,226 --> 01:36:00,461
Go. Run.

1545
01:36:00,494 --> 01:36:02,863
Watch that rear.

1546
01:36:15,342 --> 01:36:16,877
Go, go, go!

1547
01:36:25,052 --> 01:36:26,420
Back away!

1548
01:36:26,453 --> 01:36:28,922
Run, run, run!

1549
01:36:37,565 --> 01:36:39,099
Anne!

1550
01:36:39,133 --> 01:36:40,234
Ladon,

1551
01:36:41,101 --> 01:36:42,303
kill the traitor.

1552
01:37:15,235 --> 01:37:16,470
Impossible.

1553
01:37:16,503 --> 01:37:17,971
Bow him!

1554
01:37:31,985 --> 01:37:34,488
I lost it. Freddy, I can't.

1555
01:37:34,522 --> 01:37:36,323
What is a god
without her power?

1556
01:37:36,357 --> 01:37:38,492
The most powerful thing
about you

1557
01:37:38,526 --> 01:37:39,927
is you.

1558
01:37:39,960 --> 01:37:41,128
You taught me that.

1559
01:37:49,436 --> 01:37:51,238
Kill them!

1560
01:38:08,556 --> 01:38:10,658
Boom!

1561
01:38:10,692 --> 01:38:13,227
That must be super
disappointing as a dragon.

1562
01:38:15,996 --> 01:38:17,231
Assuming that you are one.

1563
01:38:17,264 --> 01:38:19,066
I mean, you fly,
and you breathe fire,

1564
01:38:19,099 --> 01:38:21,235
but you're also made of wood
which is a weird flex

1565
01:38:21,268 --> 01:38:23,470
and a serious design flaw,
if I'm being honest.

1566
01:38:24,739 --> 01:38:25,573
Freddy, Anthea, don't!

1567
01:38:29,276 --> 01:38:31,378
Ah, made you look!

1568
01:38:31,412 --> 01:38:33,113
Oh, lady, that's twice.

1569
01:38:33,147 --> 01:38:35,249
And I didn't even need
a flaming violin that time.

1570
01:38:36,618 --> 01:38:38,952
You want the staff?
Come get it.

1571
01:39:13,588 --> 01:39:15,389
Now, Hespera.

1572
01:39:17,692 --> 01:39:19,059
Now, Hespera.

1573
01:39:22,262 --> 01:39:23,631
Now. Now.

1574
01:40:24,424 --> 01:40:25,793
No.

1575
01:40:25,827 --> 01:40:27,461
No! No!

1576
01:40:51,485 --> 01:40:52,820
Remove the dome.

1577
01:40:52,854 --> 01:40:55,055
As long as I still breathe,

1578
01:40:55,823 --> 01:40:58,458
the dome still stands.

1579
01:40:58,492 --> 01:41:02,329
Till I see you
on the other side, sister.

1580
01:41:45,873 --> 01:41:47,508
Billy!

1581
01:41:47,542 --> 01:41:49,309
- Get out of there.
- I can't.

1582
01:41:49,343 --> 01:41:50,444
Billy.

1583
01:41:50,477 --> 01:41:52,145
I have to do this.

1584
01:41:54,348 --> 01:41:55,617
Billy,
what are you doing?

1585
01:41:55,650 --> 01:41:56,884
You're not supposed
to be in there.

1586
01:41:56,918 --> 01:42:00,320
Yeah, I am.

1587
01:42:00,354 --> 01:42:02,255
I used to think that
I couldn't do anything right,

1588
01:42:02,289 --> 01:42:03,891
that I didn't deserve
my powers,

1589
01:42:05,526 --> 01:42:06,861
but there's something
that I can do.

1590
01:42:07,494 --> 01:42:08,495
No.

1591
01:42:09,496 --> 01:42:11,198
I can save all of you.

1592
01:42:11,231 --> 01:42:12,667
But it's all or none!

1593
01:42:12,700 --> 01:42:14,535
Yeah.

1594
01:42:14,569 --> 01:42:16,169
All of my family gets to live
and none of them gets hurt.

1595
01:42:19,473 --> 01:42:22,275
Freddy, I've never
had a family. You know that.

1596
01:42:22,309 --> 01:42:24,311
Everybody I've ever cared
about, they all left me.

1597
01:42:24,344 --> 01:42:26,213
My mom, my dad, everyone.

1598
01:42:27,447 --> 01:42:29,316
So when I found you guys,
I had to hang on

1599
01:42:29,349 --> 01:42:30,518
and I've been hanging on
too tight.

1600
01:42:30,551 --> 01:42:31,886
No.

1601
01:42:31,919 --> 01:42:33,453
I should have let you
do your own thing.

1602
01:42:35,355 --> 01:42:37,357
Now it's time for you to fly.

1603
01:42:37,391 --> 01:42:38,392
What about you?

1604
01:42:43,430 --> 01:42:45,265
I'm Captain Everypower Junior.

1605
01:42:47,568 --> 01:42:48,936
Don't you forget it.

1606
01:43:41,723 --> 01:43:43,524
We end this now.

1607
01:43:43,558 --> 01:43:45,860
Yeah. We do.

1608
01:43:56,838 --> 01:43:58,438
Come on, Billy.

1609
01:44:26,466 --> 01:44:27,735
He's got this. We got this.

1610
01:44:27,769 --> 01:44:29,704
He's got this. He's got this.

1611
01:44:29,737 --> 01:44:30,805
Billy.

1612
01:44:35,109 --> 01:44:36,476
Fly.

1613
01:44:48,856 --> 01:44:50,825
Billy.

1614
01:44:50,858 --> 01:44:52,560
Come on, baby.
Come on, let's go!

1615
01:44:59,834 --> 01:45:01,669
No!

1616
01:45:44,679 --> 01:45:45,680
Whoa!

1617
01:45:48,616 --> 01:45:49,617
Ah.

1618
01:46:52,479 --> 01:46:54,949
Shazam!

1619
01:47:11,699 --> 01:47:12,700
Billy.

1620
01:47:14,001 --> 01:47:16,103
A true god,

1621
01:47:16,137 --> 01:47:18,172
after all.

1622
01:48:10,558 --> 01:48:11,726
He did it.

1623
01:48:19,567 --> 01:48:20,568
We must go.

1624
01:48:27,942 --> 01:48:28,943
Billy?

1625
01:48:29,610 --> 01:48:30,611
Billy?

1626
01:48:31,946 --> 01:48:32,947
Billy!

1627
01:48:34,849 --> 01:48:35,883
Billy!

1628
01:48:37,251 --> 01:48:39,854
Billy. Where are you?

1629
01:48:39,887 --> 01:48:40,955
Billy!

1630
01:48:42,923 --> 01:48:43,924
Billy?

1631
01:48:47,895 --> 01:48:49,997
Billy! Billy.

1632
01:48:52,666 --> 01:48:53,801
Billy!

1633
01:48:53,834 --> 01:48:54,835
Billy!

1634
01:48:55,870 --> 01:48:57,071
Billy!

1635
01:48:57,104 --> 01:48:58,539
Dude, wake up. You did it.

1636
01:49:01,142 --> 01:49:02,977
Okay. You're supposed
to wake up.

1637
01:49:03,010 --> 01:49:04,045
It's the part
where you wake up

1638
01:49:04,078 --> 01:49:05,880
and open your eyes and laugh

1639
01:49:05,913 --> 01:49:09,016
and you're supposed to say
you got me, 'cause you got me.

1640
01:49:10,317 --> 01:49:11,919
Dude. Joke's over, man.

1641
01:49:12,720 --> 01:49:13,788
Billy!

1642
01:49:15,956 --> 01:49:18,059
Billy. Billy, come on.

1643
01:49:20,661 --> 01:49:21,929
Freddy.

1644
01:49:25,099 --> 01:49:26,567
What did you do?

1645
01:49:28,803 --> 01:49:29,904
Wake up, Billy.

1646
01:49:29,937 --> 01:49:31,739
- Billy?
- He's over here!

1647
01:49:34,809 --> 01:49:35,810
Billy.

1648
01:49:37,244 --> 01:49:39,580
You asshole!

1649
01:49:40,915 --> 01:49:43,084
We're a team! We're a team!

1650
01:49:44,218 --> 01:49:45,219
Oh, Billy.

1651
01:49:46,687 --> 01:49:48,022
Billy.

1652
01:49:48,055 --> 01:49:50,191
Oh, my baby. No.

1653
01:49:54,862 --> 01:49:56,330
He was a hero.

1654
01:49:58,032 --> 01:50:00,401
He was a hero and a god.

1655
01:50:00,434 --> 01:50:02,736
And he should be laid
to rest like one.

1656
01:50:07,108 --> 01:50:08,375
Hey, pal.

1657
01:51:16,744 --> 01:51:18,312
Will this land ever come back?

1658
01:51:19,380 --> 01:51:22,149
The staff is drained of magic.

1659
01:51:22,183 --> 01:51:25,085
Only the spark of a god
can restore its power

1660
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,721
and there are no gods left.

1661
01:51:29,156 --> 01:51:30,424
There is one.

1662
01:51:49,143 --> 01:51:50,144
What?

1663
01:52:27,214 --> 01:52:28,516
Whoa.

1664
01:52:47,835 --> 01:52:48,869
Whoa.

1665
01:53:17,898 --> 01:53:18,899
It's a zombie!

1666
01:53:20,334 --> 01:53:22,202
Guys!

1667
01:53:23,103 --> 01:53:24,405
What the hell?

1668
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:26,373
You buried me?

1669
01:53:26,407 --> 01:53:28,942
In what, like, two minutes?

1670
01:53:28,976 --> 01:53:30,010
Oh, Billy!

1671
01:53:31,579 --> 01:53:32,913
Hey.

1672
01:53:32,946 --> 01:53:35,182
Oh, man. I missed you guys.

1673
01:53:38,118 --> 01:53:39,587
Hi. Hey.

1674
01:53:40,487 --> 01:53:42,489
Oh, my God. Hi.

1675
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,258
Why didn't anybody tell...

1676
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:46,226
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

1677
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,263
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

1678
01:53:49,296 --> 01:53:50,397
I was dead at the time.

1679
01:53:51,432 --> 01:53:52,534
So, you, uh...

1680
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,968
you got my bird letter?

1681
01:53:56,170 --> 01:53:57,438
Oh, I, uh...

1682
01:53:59,206 --> 01:54:00,474
I think you've got
something...

1683
01:54:02,276 --> 01:54:03,511
On my...

1684
01:54:03,545 --> 01:54:05,112
Where... Oh.

1685
01:54:05,680 --> 01:54:06,914
What?

1686
01:54:07,615 --> 01:54:08,650
That's a spider.

1687
01:54:08,683 --> 01:54:10,317
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

1688
01:54:10,351 --> 01:54:12,920
Also,
that's really embarrassing.

1689
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:14,154
Yes, it is.

1690
01:54:14,188 --> 01:54:16,524
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

1691
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:18,492
The sacrifice you made.

1692
01:54:18,526 --> 01:54:21,495
You brought this world
back to life.

1693
01:54:21,529 --> 01:54:23,665
Maybe this time,
gods and humans

1694
01:54:23,698 --> 01:54:25,432
can learn to live in peace.

1695
01:54:25,466 --> 01:54:26,467
Yeah.

1696
01:54:28,001 --> 01:54:29,937
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

1697
01:54:32,206 --> 01:54:33,541
Be well, Billy Batson.

1698
01:54:35,976 --> 01:54:38,546
Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

1699
01:54:38,580 --> 01:54:40,214
is surging through me,

1700
01:54:40,247 --> 01:54:42,349
that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

1701
01:54:42,383 --> 01:54:43,984
and I'm gonna be 18

1702
01:54:44,017 --> 01:54:45,620
in, like, five months, so...

1703
01:54:45,653 --> 01:54:48,055
Stick to saving
the world, kid.

1704
01:54:48,088 --> 01:54:50,057
Yeah, you know, like,
that's... Okay, cool.

1705
01:54:50,090 --> 01:54:51,559
See ya.

1706
01:54:51,593 --> 01:54:53,394
What's with our boys
and older women?

1707
01:54:56,296 --> 01:54:58,132
Hey.

1708
01:54:58,165 --> 01:54:59,567
Who wants their powers back?

1709
01:55:01,536 --> 01:55:03,538
We can do that, right?

1710
01:55:03,571 --> 01:55:04,639
-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, good.

1711
01:55:04,672 --> 01:55:06,039
Good, good, good.

1712
01:55:06,073 --> 01:55:07,675
I'd like
our house back.

1713
01:55:07,709 --> 01:55:09,042
Can we do that?

1714
01:55:11,011 --> 01:55:12,680
- Dinner!
- Coming.

1715
01:55:12,714 --> 01:55:15,082
Aw. Thank you for respecting
the cross-stitch.

1716
01:55:19,587 --> 01:55:21,155
Anthea.

1717
01:55:21,188 --> 01:55:22,389
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

1718
01:55:22,423 --> 01:55:25,159
about that god realm of yours?

1719
01:55:25,192 --> 01:55:27,729
Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

1720
01:55:27,762 --> 01:55:29,731
Spend some time
with the common folk.

1721
01:55:29,764 --> 01:55:31,398
Learn some about your world,

1722
01:55:31,432 --> 01:55:34,034
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

1723
01:55:34,067 --> 01:55:35,603
Number one sign of wisdom:

1724
01:55:35,637 --> 01:55:37,504
Admitting there's always
more to learn.

1725
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:38,972
I'm coming around to it.

1726
01:55:40,775 --> 01:55:42,109
I got it.

1727
01:55:46,413 --> 01:55:47,414
Whoa.

1728
01:55:48,248 --> 01:55:49,517
Uh, guys?

1729
01:55:50,317 --> 01:55:51,351
Guys!

1730
01:55:58,693 --> 01:55:59,960
It's the wizard.

1731
01:56:01,563 --> 01:56:03,497
- Oh, my God!
- No way!

1732
01:56:03,531 --> 01:56:05,265
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

1733
01:56:05,299 --> 01:56:06,601
Look at him, he's so handsome.

1734
01:56:06,634 --> 01:56:08,135
You pimpin' now, what is this?

1735
01:56:08,168 --> 01:56:09,704
- You look amazing.
- You look great!

1736
01:56:09,737 --> 01:56:12,039
Well, I was
in the neighborhood

1737
01:56:12,072 --> 01:56:13,575
and, um, I just wanted
to express

1738
01:56:13,608 --> 01:56:16,109
my gratitude before I go.

1739
01:56:16,143 --> 01:56:20,347
Sorry. Doorbell's broken.
Actually, everything's broken.

1740
01:56:20,380 --> 01:56:21,982
Not everything.

1741
01:56:25,052 --> 01:56:26,588
You were just
in the neighborhood?

1742
01:56:26,621 --> 01:56:29,122
Okay,
I came for the staff.

1743
01:56:29,156 --> 01:56:31,158
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

1744
01:56:31,191 --> 01:56:35,128
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

1745
01:56:35,162 --> 01:56:36,764
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

1746
01:56:36,798 --> 01:56:38,398
-Wait, what?
-No!

1747
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:40,467
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

1748
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:42,369
And besides...

1749
01:56:42,402 --> 01:56:45,205
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

1750
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:47,207
It's time to see your world.

1751
01:56:47,241 --> 01:56:48,743
It's been an honor,

1752
01:56:48,776 --> 01:56:51,478
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

1753
01:56:51,513 --> 01:56:52,780
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

1754
01:56:52,814 --> 01:56:54,348
Thank you, Jeff.

1755
01:56:54,381 --> 01:56:56,216
It never ends.

1756
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:58,553
Also,

1757
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,556
what's my superhero name?

1758
01:57:04,191 --> 01:57:06,460
Your name is...

1759
01:57:07,494 --> 01:57:09,396
Shazam.

1760
01:57:09,429 --> 01:57:10,464
-Of course.
-Yeah.

1761
01:57:14,268 --> 01:57:16,503
I still think we can beat it.

1762
01:59:55,763 --> 01:59:57,431
My feet hurt.
How much further?

1763
01:59:57,464 --> 01:59:58,666
About ten seconds less

1764
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:00,333
than the last time
you asked me.

1765
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,803
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

1766
02:00:01,836 --> 02:00:03,270
have parked
a little bit closer.

1767
02:00:03,303 --> 02:00:04,438
He doesn't know we're coming,

1768
02:00:04,471 --> 02:00:05,840
and I didn't want
to spook him.

1769
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:08,341
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

1770
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:09,711
All right, let's go.

1771
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:11,779
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

1772
02:00:11,813 --> 02:00:13,981
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

1773
02:00:14,015 --> 02:00:15,616
we never actually met him

1774
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:17,985
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

1775
02:00:18,019 --> 02:00:19,921
Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

1776
02:00:19,954 --> 02:00:21,889
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

1777
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:24,892
-I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

1778
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:27,962
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

1779
02:00:27,995 --> 02:00:29,764
but a little immature.

1780
02:00:29,797 --> 02:00:30,932
Oh, great.

1781
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:34,468
Whoo!

1782
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,879
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

1783
02:00:44,912 --> 02:00:46,681
I mean, no.

1784
02:00:46,714 --> 02:00:48,415
I've never heard that name
in my life.

1785
02:00:48,448 --> 02:00:49,751
I don't know who
you're talking about.

1786
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:51,418
But I'd like to meet
that person

1787
02:00:51,451 --> 02:00:53,286
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

1788
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,990
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

1789
02:00:56,023 --> 02:00:57,625
but, like, in a dangerous way.

1790
02:00:57,658 --> 02:00:59,560
What the hell
are you talking about?

1791
02:00:59,594 --> 02:01:01,696
Relax. We know who you are.

1792
02:01:01,729 --> 02:01:03,865
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

1793
02:01:04,899 --> 02:01:05,933
Who are you guys?

1794
02:01:05,967 --> 02:01:07,434
Don't worry about that either.

1795
02:01:07,467 --> 02:01:09,302
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

1796
02:01:09,336 --> 02:01:10,872
And we're here
to make you an offer.

1797
02:01:10,905 --> 02:01:11,973
How would you like to join

1798
02:01:12,006 --> 02:01:13,340
-the Justice...
-Yes!

1799
02:01:13,373 --> 02:01:14,742
A thousand times yes!

1800
02:01:14,776 --> 02:01:16,677
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

1801
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:18,679
Well, I mean,
not this exactly.

1802
02:01:18,713 --> 02:01:19,747
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

1803
02:01:19,781 --> 02:01:20,948
in the dream, but...

1804
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:22,550
-Ew.
-Huh?

1805
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:24,719
Well, that was easy.

1806
02:01:24,752 --> 02:01:26,386
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

1807
02:01:26,419 --> 02:01:28,421
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

1808
02:01:28,455 --> 02:01:29,690
The Justice Society?

1809
02:01:29,724 --> 02:01:31,025
Is that different
than the Justice League?

1810
02:01:31,058 --> 02:01:32,794
Yes. The Justice Society

1811
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,361
is different
than the Justice League

1812
02:01:34,394 --> 02:01:36,030
because of how words work.

1813
02:01:36,063 --> 02:01:37,999
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

1814
02:01:38,032 --> 02:01:40,433
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

1815
02:01:40,467 --> 02:01:42,435
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

1816
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:44,371
He's joking, right?

1817
02:01:44,404 --> 02:01:47,642
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

1818
02:01:47,675 --> 02:01:49,677
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

1819
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:51,712
Can you drive by and get me?

1820
02:01:51,746 --> 02:01:54,115
Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

1821
02:01:54,148 --> 02:01:55,583
It's pretty confusing
that there are

1822
02:01:55,616 --> 02:01:57,618
two separate groups
of superheroes

1823
02:01:57,652 --> 02:01:59,053
that are totally unaffiliated,

1824
02:01:59,086 --> 02:02:01,122
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

1825
02:02:01,155 --> 02:02:03,423
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing
a rebranding of sorts?

1826
02:02:03,456 --> 02:02:06,127
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

1827
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,029
you got so many options, man.

1828
02:02:08,062 --> 02:02:11,098
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

1829
02:02:11,132 --> 02:02:12,900
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

1830
02:02:12,934 --> 02:02:14,467
These are, like, legal terms.

1831
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:17,605
"The Avenger Society."

1832
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,608
I like that, for some reason.

1833
02:08:56,103 --> 02:09:00,140
Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

1834
02:09:00,174 --> 02:09:02,042
Where in the hell
have you been?

1835
02:09:02,076 --> 02:09:05,112
To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

1836
02:09:05,145 --> 02:09:07,414
one must have patience.

1837
02:09:07,448 --> 02:09:09,016
What are you talking about?

1838
02:09:10,585 --> 02:09:12,486
It's been two goddamn years!

1839
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,458
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

1840
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:18,993
A meaningless measure.

1841
02:09:19,026 --> 02:09:21,529
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

1842
02:09:21,563 --> 02:09:24,965
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

1843
02:09:24,999 --> 02:09:26,967
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

1844
02:09:27,001 --> 02:09:29,403
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

1845
02:09:29,436 --> 02:09:32,172
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

1846
02:09:32,206 --> 02:09:35,042
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

1847
02:09:35,075 --> 02:09:38,412
I just slither around
endlessly.

1848
02:09:38,445 --> 02:09:41,015
But not for long.

1849
02:09:43,884 --> 02:09:45,419
Tell me everything.

1850
02:09:47,054 --> 02:09:49,123
Just one more thing
I need to do.

1851
02:09:49,156 --> 02:09:51,158
What? No!

1852
02:09:52,594 --> 02:09:52,661
Oh, goddamn it!

1852
02:09:53,305 --> 02:10:53,876
