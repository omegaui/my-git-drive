[docent] The lore tells us
of a valiant few

7
00:01:10,572 --> 00:01:13,307
who stood above the fray
and fog.

8
00:01:13,340 --> 00:01:15,777
My, what weapons
they must have wielded.

9
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:18,211
Which brings us
to our current exhibit,

10
00:01:18,245 --> 00:01:20,748
the mythical staff
of the gods.

11
00:01:20,782 --> 00:01:22,517
In Homer's tale,

12
00:01:22,550 --> 00:01:26,754
the staff was said to harness
the gift of all gods.

13
00:01:26,788 --> 00:01:29,791
Oh. [chuckles]
Welcome, proud soldiers.

00:01:29,824 --> 00:01:31,124
What did I say?

15
00:01:31,158 --> 00:01:32,492
Museums are fun.

16
00:01:32,527 --> 00:01:35,462

there's no reason

00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,902
Everyone will get a chance

00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,374
the two halves
of this ancient replica

23
00:01:47,407 --> 00:01:49,611
were recently discovered in,
of all places,

24
00:01:49,644 --> 00:01:53,313
a waste processing plant
outside of Philadelphia.

25
00:01:53,347 --> 00:01:54,649
So strong,
they reportedly broke

26
00:01:54,682 --> 00:01:56,618
-three trash compactors.
-[thuds]

Let's have more of it.

68
00:05:08,509 --> 00:05:11,579
We can do nothing while
the staff remains sundered.

69
00:05:11,612 --> 00:05:13,981
The champions of this realm
outnumber us.

70
00:05:14,015 --> 00:05:17,118
Human champions
are still humans

71
00:05:17,151 --> 00:05:18,953
and we are gods.

72
00:05:18,986 --> 00:05:21,889
Do not underestimate
the judgement of the wizard.

73
00:05:21,923 --> 00:05:24,125
To protect the power
of the gods,

74
00:05:24,158 --> 00:05:26,961
he will have chosen
with meticulous precision

75
00:05:26,994 --> 00:05:30,832
the strongest, most keenly
intelligent champions

76
00:05:30,865 --> 00:05:33,134
this realm has ever witnessed.

77
00:05:33,167 --> 00:05:35,803
I'm an idiot.

78
00:05:35,837 --> 00:05:37,872
I don't deserve these powers,
if I'm being honest.

79
00:05:37,905 --> 00:05:39,674
Like, what am I even
contributing?

80
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,609
There's already a superhero
with a red suit,

81
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:42,743
with a lightning bolt on it

82
00:05:42,777 --> 00:05:44,846
and I'm fast, but he's faster.

83
00:05:44,879 --> 00:05:48,649
Aquaman is literally huge,
and he's so manly

84
00:05:48,683 --> 00:05:49,951
and Batman is so cool!

85
00:05:49,984 --> 00:05:52,053
And I'm just me.

86
00:05:52,086 --> 00:05:53,621
And I can't say this
to anyone else,

87
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,022
'cause my family looks to me
as a leader,

88
00:05:55,056 --> 00:05:56,958
but I feel like

89
00:05:56,991 --> 00:05:58,092
a fraud.

90
00:05:58,125 --> 00:05:59,594
You understand I'm a...

91
00:06:00,661 --> 00:06:01,963
pediatrician,

92
00:06:03,931 --> 00:06:05,733
right?

93
00:06:05,766 --> 00:06:07,802
I mean, yeah, well,
you were recommended

94
00:06:07,835 --> 00:06:09,604
by another patient,
Billy Batson.

95
00:06:09,637 --> 00:06:10,905
It doesn't matter.

96
00:06:10,938 --> 00:06:12,773
Can you help fix my thoughts
so that

97
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:14,742
they just, like, you know,
stop happening?

98
00:06:14,775 --> 00:06:16,143
All right, look.

99
00:06:16,177 --> 00:06:17,812
And, again, pediatrician,
not a psychiatrist,

100
00:06:17,845 --> 00:06:19,780
but it sounds to me like

101
00:06:19,814 --> 00:06:22,650
you're experiencing
imposter syndrome.

102
00:06:22,683 --> 00:06:25,887
And often, that originates
from trauma early in life,

103
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:28,488
so if you don't
mind me asking,

104
00:06:28,522 --> 00:06:30,524
how well do you remember
your childhood?

105
00:06:30,558 --> 00:06:31,926
Like it was today. [chuckles]

106
00:06:32,894 --> 00:06:34,829
Trauma? Uh, I don't know.

107
00:06:34,862 --> 00:06:36,463
I mean, I never met my dad.

108
00:06:36,496 --> 00:06:39,834
Uh, my mom abandoned me
at a Christmas carnival.

109
00:06:39,867 --> 00:06:41,468
I spent a lot of time
in the foster system,

110
00:06:41,502 --> 00:06:42,570
ran away from 11 homes,

111
00:06:42,603 --> 00:06:43,804
got into a lot of fights.

112
00:06:43,838 --> 00:06:45,039
Then I was abducted
by a wizard

113
00:06:45,072 --> 00:06:46,674
who gave me superpowers

114
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:48,209
and then dude just, like,
died in front of my face.

115
00:06:48,242 --> 00:06:49,610
That's not a small amount.

116
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:50,978
A doctor conjured seven demons

117
00:06:51,012 --> 00:06:52,546
and held my whole family
hostage,

118
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:53,915
so we had to rip out
one of his eyeballs,

119
00:06:53,948 --> 00:06:55,750
and then everybody
got superpowers,

120
00:06:55,783 --> 00:06:57,585
but now everyone's kind of,
like, doing their own thing

121
00:06:57,618 --> 00:06:59,153
and I'm the only one trying
to keep everybody together.

122
00:06:59,186 --> 00:07:02,156
Okay, okay.
Well, let's just process that.

123
00:07:02,189 --> 00:07:04,792
Right?
Rejected by your parents,

124
00:07:04,825 --> 00:07:06,459
then by the system,

125
00:07:06,493 --> 00:07:09,030
and now rejected by a city
you try to protect.

126
00:07:09,063 --> 00:07:10,765
I never said I was rejected
by my city.

127
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:14,201
"Rejected by city."

-Anyway, okay, well, um...

130
00:07:19,006 --> 00:07:21,776
I, uh, appreciate your help,
but I got some real problems.

131
00:07:21,809 --> 00:07:26,247
There's this terrorist hostage
situation going on, so...

-Yeah.

00:17:15,168 --> 00:17:16,604
So,

328
00:17:16,638 --> 00:17:18,171
let's go back to the tape.

329
00:17:18,205 --> 00:17:19,774
Now, guys, as you can see,

330
00:17:19,807 --> 00:17:22,644
we started off real, real,
real, real strong, right?

331
00:17:22,677 --> 00:17:25,445
Right up top, all that
cohesiveness, energy,

332
00:17:25,479 --> 00:17:27,214
-terrific!
-[cell phone ringing]

333
00:17:27,247 --> 00:17:30,384
Oh, sorry, Coach.
Gotta fly IRL.

334
00:17:30,417 --> 00:17:31,719
No, no, no, I'm not done
with the presentation.

335
00:17:31,753 --> 00:17:33,420
I know. And I love
these daily recaps.

336
00:17:33,453 --> 00:17:35,690
I just gotta spread my wings
a bit before dinner.

337
00:17:35,723 --> 00:17:37,792
-It helps keep me loose!
-Okay, fine, fine. No recap.

338
00:17:37,825 --> 00:17:39,326
We'll go have a group hang
in the air. That sounds great.

339
00:17:39,359 --> 00:17:40,862
I gotta test this slime
for toxicity

340
00:17:40,895 --> 00:17:43,230
'cause I'm starting to...
tingle.

341
00:17:43,263 --> 00:17:46,233
Oh. The, uh, Phillies game
just came on

342
00:17:46,266 --> 00:17:49,269
so I'm gonna go ahead
and, uh, watch baseball.

343
00:17:49,303 --> 00:17:51,405
It's right that I give
Tawny back.

344
00:17:53,273 --> 00:17:54,709
[Shazam] Oh, come on!
What is happening?

345
00:17:54,742 --> 00:17:56,778
What is happening right now?
All or none, guys!

346
00:17:56,811 --> 00:17:58,245
If you say you have to work...

347
00:17:58,278 --> 00:17:59,647
I have to work.

348
00:17:59,681 --> 00:18:01,816
[sighs, chuckles]
Why do you even have a job?

349
00:18:01,849 --> 00:18:03,216
Wonder Woman
doesn't have a job!

350
00:18:03,250 --> 00:18:04,652
-Stop.
-No, seriously.

351
00:18:04,686 --> 00:18:05,820
Do you think she wears
a ponytail and glasses

352
00:18:05,853 --> 00:18:07,454
and, like, nobody
recognizes her

353
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:08,823
and she's, like, an accountant
or something?

354
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:11,458
Just stop.
You are holding on too tight.

355
00:18:11,491 --> 00:18:14,294
Just 'cause Freddy wants
to fly solo for ten minutes

356
00:18:14,328 --> 00:18:16,698
doesn't mean he's gonna
leave you like your mom.

357
00:18:16,731 --> 00:18:18,633
Or me wanting to go to college

358
00:18:18,666 --> 00:18:20,267
means I'm abandoning
the family.

359
00:18:20,300 --> 00:18:21,703
Oh. Okay, cool,

360
00:18:21,736 --> 00:18:23,671
it's about college again.
I totally get it.

361
00:18:23,705 --> 00:18:24,839
Yeah.

362
00:18:24,872 --> 00:18:26,674
Do you really
not see yourself?

363
00:18:26,708 --> 00:18:27,709
[sighs]

364
00:18:33,748 --> 00:18:35,482
You turn 18 in five months.

365
00:18:35,516 --> 00:18:37,752
They're not gonna kick me out.
They didn't kick you out.

366
00:18:37,785 --> 00:18:40,387
Victor and Rosa
are saints, yes,
but you're about to age out

367
00:18:40,420 --> 00:18:42,322
of the foster system
just like I did.

368
00:18:42,356 --> 00:18:44,926
Yeah, I get it.
I know how it works, okay?

369
00:18:44,959 --> 00:18:45,760
Do you?

370
00:18:47,461 --> 00:18:49,897
Victor and Rosa
can barely pay rent.

371
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,834
And the state no longer sends
checks to feed or house me

372
00:18:52,867 --> 00:18:54,902
and soon there will be
no checks for you.

373
00:18:56,403 --> 00:18:59,674
I don't care if Wonder Woman
has a job.

374
00:18:59,707 --> 00:19:01,408
I want to contribute.

375
00:19:01,441 --> 00:19:03,310
At some point, Billy, like

376
00:19:03,343 --> 00:19:05,580
everyone on Earth,
we have to get a job or...

377
00:19:06,380 --> 00:19:07,381
leave home.

378
00:19:13,521 --> 00:19:14,789
Nothing lasts forever.

[door opens, closes]

I mean, it's literally called
the Rock of Eternity.

381
00:19:29,904 --> 00:19:33,206
So, clearly, some things
do last forever.

Magic.

Impossible.

389
00:20:28,529 --> 00:20:30,698
This realm was sealed off
from magic.

390
00:20:30,732 --> 00:20:35,435
Yes. After you ripped it
from our father's very core.

391
00:20:35,469 --> 00:20:38,271
From every god in this realm.

392
00:20:38,305 --> 00:20:39,674
From me.

393
00:20:39,707 --> 00:20:42,510
[bar sizzling]

394
00:20:42,543 --> 00:20:44,746
Do you not remember
what you took?

395
00:20:44,779 --> 00:20:47,715
What my particular power was?

396
00:20:47,749 --> 00:20:50,317
The power of elements.

397
00:20:50,350 --> 00:20:53,855
No. I cast a barrier
to prevent your kind

398
00:20:53,888 --> 00:20:55,857
from entering the human realm.

399
00:20:55,890 --> 00:20:58,059
The only way that barrier
could be removed is if--

400

Someone broke this?

Where is the Champion?

403
00:21:04,599 --> 00:21:07,367
It was your hands that forged
this staff for our father

404
00:21:07,400 --> 00:21:09,670
and yours that will mend it.

00:24:47,655 --> 00:24:48,956
Thanks. [chuckles]

487
00:24:49,790 --> 00:24:51,258
So, from the top.

488
00:24:51,292 --> 00:24:54,628
What is Thundercrack's
Make-A-Wish kid?

489
00:24:54,662 --> 00:24:58,699
Yeah. Um, it's real inside
baseball, but basically,

490
00:24:58,733 --> 00:25:01,102
a while ago I happened
to have some lunch

491
00:25:01,135 --> 00:25:03,104
in the cafeteria
with a few superheroes.

492
00:25:03,137 --> 00:25:06,140
Wait, the kid who's friends
with superheroes.

493
00:25:06,173 --> 00:25:07,675
-That was you?
-Yeah.

494
00:25:07,708 --> 00:25:09,310
And they're still dicks
to you?

495
00:25:09,343 --> 00:25:10,878
Sadly, just 'cause
you know someone cool,

496
00:25:10,911 --> 00:25:13,247
doesn't really necessarily
make you cool.

497
00:25:13,280 --> 00:25:14,749
You seem pretty cool to me.

498
00:25:17,585 --> 00:25:18,586
[loudly] Freddy!

499
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:21,956
Is my name.

500
00:25:21,989 --> 00:25:24,792
Sorry, that was weird
and loud. I'm Freddy,

501
00:25:24,825 --> 00:25:26,293
he said in a normal voice.

502
00:25:26,327 --> 00:25:27,528
I'm Anne.

503
00:25:29,597 --> 00:25:30,798
Anne.

-Nice!
-Bullseye.

506
00:25:33,300 --> 00:25:35,002
Hey, you gotta fix
that crutch, bro!

507
00:25:35,036 --> 00:25:36,037
[chuckles]

508
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:38,005
What?

509
00:25:38,039 --> 00:25:39,040

[in English] Good, little one.
Well done.

517
00:26:17,411 --> 00:26:20,314
Now go find me the one
responsible for this.

518

00:26:37,431 --> 00:26:39,667
Wow. Um... [chuckles]

521
00:26:39,700 --> 00:26:42,403
I'm flattered
that you feel this way.

522
00:26:42,436 --> 00:26:45,339
Truly, I mean, you know, like,
look at all this, you know...

523
00:26:45,372 --> 00:26:47,741
Romantic setting

524
00:26:47,775 --> 00:26:50,144
and fancy champagne,
big plates, tiny food.

525
00:26:50,177 --> 00:26:51,779
I mean, you went all out.

526
00:26:52,780 --> 00:26:54,882
I love that, I, I, I, I do.

527
00:26:54,915 --> 00:26:56,650
I'm just not sure

528
00:26:56,684 --> 00:26:58,652
that I'm really ready
to commit right now, you know.

529
00:26:58,686 --> 00:27:01,155
Wait, wait, wait.
No, this isn't about you.

530
00:27:01,188 --> 00:27:05,793
I promise this is
not about you. Okay?
Look... [chuckles]

531
00:27:05,826 --> 00:27:07,761
I know the whole world wants
to see this happen.

532
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:09,263
You and me.

533
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:12,933
The dynamic duo.
The hottie goddies. [chuckles]

She-zam.

535
00:27:16,103 --> 00:27:18,372
I guess I'm just afraid
that I'm...

536
00:27:18,405 --> 00:27:20,841
gonna let 'em all down.
You know?

537
00:27:22,343 --> 00:27:23,377
That I'm gonna let you down.

538
00:27:28,349 --> 00:27:30,718
You know what?
Screw it. Let's try.

539
00:27:30,751 --> 00:27:31,919
Let's try this crazy thing.

540
00:27:33,154 --> 00:27:34,155
Maybe we'll, uh...

541
00:27:36,891 --> 00:27:38,392
seal it with a kiss?

You are a fool of a champion.

00:27:55,943 --> 00:27:58,012
What the hell...
What the hell is going on?

546
00:27:58,045 --> 00:27:59,280
What happened
to her beautiful face?

547
00:27:59,313 --> 00:28:01,048
Also, aren't you,
like, dead-ass dead?

548
00:28:01,081 --> 00:28:03,250
I bring a warning
from beyond your realm.

549
00:28:03,284 --> 00:28:05,252
The daughters of Atlas
are coming for you.

550
00:28:05,286 --> 00:28:06,453
Daughters of Atlas?

551
00:28:06,487 --> 00:28:08,055
They're coming to unmake
your world

552
00:28:08,088 --> 00:28:11,025
and torture mankind
for all eternity

553
00:28:11,058 --> 00:28:13,827
-in the Pit of Endless Agony.
-Okay, I feel like maybe

554
00:28:13,861 --> 00:28:14,929
I should be writing
all this down.

555

-Quiet!
-Okay, okay.

556
00:28:16,130 --> 00:28:18,098
You don't know
what you've done.

557
00:28:18,132 --> 00:28:20,134
I regret ever choosing you.

558
00:28:20,167 --> 00:28:21,902
Because of you,

559
00:28:21,936 --> 00:28:23,938
the barrier between the world
has been brought down.

560
00:28:23,971 --> 00:28:25,406
They will be hunting
for you now.

561
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:26,440
Hunting your family.

562
00:28:29,476 --> 00:28:31,011
[Shazam] Hmm?

563
00:28:31,045 --> 00:28:33,948
Oh, they're coming.
Listen to me, Billy.

564
00:28:33,981 --> 00:28:36,317
The fate of your world
depends on it.

565
00:28:36,350 --> 00:28:38,786
One thing you absolutely
must not allow

566
00:28:38,819 --> 00:28:41,021
the daughters of Atlas
to do is...

[Freddy] Nope, over it.
Done it.

are you kidding me? [gasps]

Hi.

-Oh, hi! Yes, I mean, hi.
-Hi. [chuckles]

585
00:29:45,587 --> 00:29:47,087
Um, you wanna show me

586
00:29:47,121 --> 00:29:48,989
where you were sitting
when it happened?

587
00:29:51,158 --> 00:29:52,560
Oh, yeah, of course. Totally.

588
00:29:52,594 --> 00:29:54,428
-Yeah. Follow me.
-Okay, yeah.

589

So, basically,
it's a table down at the end.

[people chattering]

So I was sitting, yeah...

Basically, I was sitting
right here, and he was sitting

right there.

-I feel that, clearly.
-[chuckles]

Always thinks she knows
better, too.

Even when it's been
factually proven otherwise?

603
00:30:20,354 --> 00:30:22,222
Exactly. And it's not
that I don't love her.

604
00:30:22,256 --> 00:30:24,425
No, of course. It'd just be

What a coinkidink! Um...

613
00:30:40,307 --> 00:30:42,276
I was just telling
my friend Anne

614
00:30:42,309 --> 00:30:45,179
-what a great guy you are.
-We need to talk.

615
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:46,648
We need to talk.
This guy loves to talk.

-He's a great talker.
-Freddy.

-I have to talk to him.
I'll be right back.
-Okay.

Wait, didn't you tell us
the wizard disintegrated?

619
00:30:54,922 --> 00:30:56,123
The skin peeled off his face.

620
00:30:56,156 --> 00:30:58,025
He turned into a literal
pile of ash.

621
00:30:58,058 --> 00:31:00,160
-Yeah, seems definitive.
-I dunno.

622
00:31:00,194 --> 00:31:03,330
Yeah. Except now
he's in my dreams

623
00:31:03,364 --> 00:31:04,932
and, Freddy, he's trying
to give me a message.

624
00:31:04,965 --> 00:31:06,534
[snaps fingers] Could be
astral projection powers.

-Obi-Wan Kenobi-ing you

-from the great beyond?
-That's it, I'm calling

after school.

-I want you there.
-Where else am I gonna go?

-What?
-Dude.

[Freddy reading indistinctly]

631
00:31:17,712 --> 00:31:20,147
Okay, first of all,
I didn't explode it!

632
00:31:20,180 --> 00:31:21,616
All right? It was already
like that and, and, and...

633
00:31:21,649 --> 00:31:23,183
What is that, the <i>Tribune?</i>
It's fake news!

634
00:31:23,217 --> 00:31:24,619
Freddy, we only have one rule.

635
00:31:24,652 --> 00:31:26,120
[both] All or none.

636
00:31:26,153 --> 00:31:27,421
And it's a stupid rule,
by the way.

637
00:31:27,454 --> 00:31:29,156
I have a girl talking
to me, Billy.

638
00:31:29,189 --> 00:31:31,024
A girl. For the first time
in my life!

639
00:31:31,058 --> 00:31:32,993
And I probably don't have
a shot in hell with this girl,

640
00:31:33,026 --> 00:31:34,562
but I'll never find out

641
00:31:34,596 --> 00:31:36,029
if you keep trying to control
everything I wanna do!

642
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:37,398
Just be at the Rock, Freddy.

643
00:31:37,431 --> 00:31:40,467
[sighs] Okay. Mmm.

644
00:31:40,501 --> 00:31:42,670
By the way, uh,
she has a sister.

645
00:31:42,704 --> 00:31:44,271
Total control freak.

646
00:31:44,304 --> 00:31:45,673
I think you guys
would get along.

647
00:31:45,707 --> 00:31:47,575
Think you'd love her,
actually.

[Shazam] <i>Look, look, look. Fam,</i>

649

I know it sounds crazy.

650
00:31:50,411 --> 00:31:52,146
And, and obviously
I don't know

651
00:31:52,179 --> 00:31:54,148
exactly what this all means

652
00:31:54,181 --> 00:31:55,683
but, but he was super aggro

653
00:31:55,717 --> 00:31:57,719
and super loud and he was
trying to warn us, I think.

654
00:31:57,752 --> 00:31:59,353
He was yelling about all this

655
00:31:59,386 --> 00:32:00,954
wizard-y mumbo-jumbo
about realms and stuff.

656
00:32:00,988 --> 00:32:03,490
Do you have to talk so loud?

657
00:32:03,525 --> 00:32:05,492
Yeah, Mary, 'cause this is not
that loud.

658
00:32:05,527 --> 00:32:08,328
I think this is
a perfectly acceptable
indoor voice volume.

659
00:32:08,362 --> 00:32:09,697
What is the deal?
Are you okay?

660
00:32:09,731 --> 00:32:12,966
-Yeah.
-Why do you have
sunglasses on?

661
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,301
Did you go to the eye doctor
this morning?

-[snorts]
-[Shazam chuckles]

663
00:32:16,203 --> 00:32:18,640
I dunno, it looks to me like
Mary did go to the eye doctor,

664
00:32:18,673 --> 00:32:21,475
but it was last night,
and she had a lot of fun.

665
00:32:21,509 --> 00:32:24,512
In point of fact,
I did have a great time.

666
00:32:24,546 --> 00:32:27,481
I met other people my age
and I enjoyed myself.

667
00:32:27,515 --> 00:32:29,751
You made friends
at the eye doctor?

668
00:32:29,784 --> 00:32:31,385
No, she...

669
00:32:31,418 --> 00:32:33,020
Yeah, can we get back
on track?

670
00:32:33,053 --> 00:32:34,522
Listen, he's yelling at me

671
00:32:34,556 --> 00:32:36,524
and he's saying the daughters
of Atlas

672
00:32:36,558 --> 00:32:38,492
are coming to hunt us.

673
00:32:38,526 --> 00:32:40,027
So, check out what I found.

674
00:32:40,060 --> 00:32:41,529
"The daughters of Atlas
are the offspring

675
00:32:41,563 --> 00:32:42,764
of the Titan Atlas..."

676
00:32:42,797 --> 00:32:44,398
which is obvious,

677
00:32:44,431 --> 00:32:48,570
but also Nyx, the Goddess
of Night and Death.

678
00:32:48,603 --> 00:32:51,104
Well, good things
can happen at night.

679
00:32:51,138 --> 00:32:52,640
-And death.

680
00:32:52,674 --> 00:32:54,509

"The daughters

And I am suddenly here
for this.

00:33:14,161 --> 00:33:15,597
I know, right?

689
00:33:15,630 --> 00:33:17,097
'Cause, like, on one hand,
totally terrifying.

Mary. What are we doin'?

692
00:33:20,602 --> 00:33:23,403
I don't know, man.
This is your meeting.

693
00:33:23,437 --> 00:33:26,073
Right, yes, fine, but we all
need to be on the same page

694
00:33:26,106 --> 00:33:27,675
and, and, and look,

695
00:33:27,709 --> 00:33:30,545
I often think that you think
better than me.

696
00:33:30,578 --> 00:33:34,314
The wizard
did not exactly give me
a tutorial here, guys, okay?

697
00:33:34,348 --> 00:33:36,383
Like, I don't know
how a lot of this stuff works.

698
00:33:36,416 --> 00:33:38,452
That, that room of doors,
or that violin

699

that is, like,
constantly burning

00:33:41,221 --> 00:33:42,624
definitely keeps
the lair cozy, right?

00:33:42,657 --> 00:33:45,693
He didn't even tell me
my superhero name.

And it's not like
I'm not tryin'.

703
00:33:48,195 --> 00:33:50,364
But I really,
really need your help.

704
00:33:51,766 --> 00:33:55,369
Uh, I might know somebody
that can help.

705

So, I'm mapping out
the entire lair

710

and you withhold this?

711
00:34:43,216 --> 00:34:43,851
[Shazam] And you have really
been holding out on us.

-Whoa!
-[Shazam] "Whoa" what?

[chuckles] What?
You call the pen "Steve"?

717
00:34:56,330 --> 00:34:57,832
Yeah, I thought he looked
like a "Steve."

-Hmm.
-Seriously. Ask him.

723

You can just ask him stuff?

-Pretty much.
-[Shazam] Slick. Okay, cool.

for information

about the daughters of Atlas.

727

Can you please help us
with that?

728
00:35:30,230 --> 00:35:32,199
-These are book titles.
-[Shazam] Okay.

what his thing is anymore.

never been up here.

Don't lie. [chuckles]
This is where you hang out

736
00:35:50,918 --> 00:35:53,353
with your superhero friends,
isn't it?

737
00:35:53,387 --> 00:35:55,623
No, actually, why would
they ever have to...
Why would they ever come here?

738
00:35:55,657 --> 00:35:57,391
I mean they have, yes,
they've driven by...

739
00:35:57,424 --> 00:35:59,326
Do you actually know
those guys?

740

Or is this like
a "Canadian girlfriend"
situation?

Oh, you mean Collette?
Well, she and I

742
00:36:03,698 --> 00:36:05,399
aren't really exclusive,
as of now.

743

744
00:36:08,736 --> 00:36:09,737
Do you wanna meet one of them?

Meet, like how?

746
00:36:11,706 --> 00:36:13,206
Like, face-to-face, right now.

I'm gonna take that as a yes.

748
00:36:15,643 --> 00:36:16,878
And today is your lucky day,

749
00:36:16,911 --> 00:36:18,846
because I'm gonna call
the hot one.

750
00:36:19,747 --> 00:36:21,314
Her?

751

-No, the male hot one.
-Him?

752
00:36:23,951 --> 00:36:25,687
What? Him?

753
00:36:25,720 --> 00:36:27,588
Look, I mean, it's all
subjective, right? But, um...

754
00:36:27,622 --> 00:36:29,691
Captain Everypower usually
tops most online polls

755
00:36:29,724 --> 00:36:31,559
so... It's no big deal.

756
00:36:31,592 --> 00:36:33,561
Is this a joke, Freddy?

757

'Cause I didn't mean
to make you
actually prove it, really.

758

No, it's not a joke.
And I'm gonna

00:36:41,602 --> 00:36:43,403
call him right now.
I'm gonna call him right now.

So, don't move.
So, stay right there.

Hey, Captain Everypower.
What's goin' on?

762
00:36:48,609 --> 00:36:51,411
It's your boy Freddy. Yeah.

763
00:36:51,445 --> 00:36:52,580
Remember that time
I saved your life?

764

No, no, no, the other time.

Friend of Freddy's, I hear.

772
00:37:14,068 --> 00:37:16,938
I am, actually. Yeah.
How are you...

773
00:37:20,307 --> 00:37:22,877
[sighs] You know, I may be
the one with the superpowers,

774
00:37:22,910 --> 00:37:24,011
but that kid,

775
00:37:24,045 --> 00:37:25,646
he's the real hero.

776
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:27,749
Yeah. I mean, honestly,

777
00:37:27,782 --> 00:37:29,483
I've never met anyone
like him.

778
00:37:29,517 --> 00:37:31,786
He's... genuine

779
00:37:31,819 --> 00:37:34,589
and warm and funny. [chuckles]

Until the rebellion when
the humans turned on the gods.

I'm reading about that
right now.

791
00:37:57,612 --> 00:37:59,312
So, apparently, all of this

792
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:01,414
revolves around

of the daughters of Atlas,
obviously, yeah,

795

he crafted a quarterstaff
from the Tree of Life

796
00:38:07,588 --> 00:38:10,091
and he used that staff to
give powers to certain deities

797
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:13,027
but also to take powers away
from others.

798
00:38:13,060 --> 00:38:16,664
So, the staff's where Atlas
stored all supernatural power.

799
00:38:16,697 --> 00:38:20,535
Yes, exactly. It's like a,
a battery for magic.

00:38:20,568 --> 00:38:22,036
But when things got bad,

801
00:38:22,069 --> 00:38:25,039
a council of human wizards
got together and they

802
00:38:25,072 --> 00:38:26,574
stole the staff from Atlas.

803
00:38:26,607 --> 00:38:28,441
And they used that to take
his powers away.

804
00:38:28,475 --> 00:38:29,844
And once they had his magic
they went after other gods...

805
00:38:29,877 --> 00:38:31,444
Guys, that's the wizard!
I know this guy,

806
00:38:31,478 --> 00:38:33,380
this is the wizard
that I know!

807
00:38:33,413 --> 00:38:34,549
What do these say?

808
00:38:40,021 --> 00:38:41,488
"The Wisdom of Solomon,

809
00:38:41,522 --> 00:38:43,057
Strength of Hercules,
Stamina of Atlas,

810
00:38:43,090 --> 00:38:44,792
Power of Zeus,
Courage of Achilles,

811
00:38:44,826 --> 00:38:47,094
Speed of Mercury." These are
the powers they stole.

812
00:38:48,529 --> 00:38:49,530
No.

813
00:38:51,599 --> 00:38:52,633
Whoa, guys, look!

814
00:38:52,667 --> 00:38:54,135
This is what the name means.

815
00:38:54,168 --> 00:38:55,736
Which is way cooler
than what I thought it was,

816
00:38:55,770 --> 00:38:57,738
which is just a bunch
of hot garbage, so.

817
00:38:57,772 --> 00:39:00,908
If I may point out one
of the powers
that may be possibly MIA.

818
00:39:00,942 --> 00:39:02,543
Boop.

819
00:39:02,577 --> 00:39:03,644
[Shazam] I'm sorry,

820
00:39:03,678 --> 00:39:05,546
are you very unsubtly implying

821
00:39:05,580 --> 00:39:08,115
that I somehow lack
the wisdom of

822
00:39:08,149 --> 00:39:10,017
-Solo Man?
-Yeah.

823
00:39:11,018 --> 00:39:12,820
Well, maybe it comes later.

824
00:39:12,854 --> 00:39:14,822
I mean you do usually ask Mary
what to do.

825
00:39:14,856 --> 00:39:15,890
-I'm just saying.
-Yeah.

826
00:39:15,923 --> 00:39:17,390
This is very, very hurtful.

827
00:39:17,424 --> 00:39:18,559
I just want you all
to know that.

828
00:39:18,593 --> 00:39:19,961
And it's pronounced "Solomon."

829
00:39:19,994 --> 00:39:21,529
-Oh.
-[Shazam clears throat]

830

What else
have we learned, fam?

831
00:39:23,164 --> 00:39:27,702
Well, once the staff contained
the powers of the gods,

832
00:39:27,735 --> 00:39:32,006
the wizards apparently
encased the God Realm in some

833
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:34,108
magical sphere

834
00:39:34,141 --> 00:39:36,010
sealing it away forever.

835
00:39:36,043 --> 00:39:38,411
Cut off from magic.

836
00:39:38,445 --> 00:39:40,514
Oh, so that's what
that was about.

837
00:39:40,548 --> 00:39:43,651
Yeah, I don't think that
they are so cut off anymore.

838
00:39:45,820 --> 00:39:47,922
<i>A bizarre and gruesome scene</i>

839
00:39:47,955 --> 00:39:49,757

<i>this morning.</i>

840
00:39:49,790 --> 00:39:51,826
<i>Two women dressed in what</i>
<i>appears to be ancient Greek...</i>

841
00:39:51,859 --> 00:39:53,895
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
that's the wizard's staff.
How did they get that?

842
00:39:53,928 --> 00:39:55,763
So, all those statues
used to be people.

843
00:39:55,796 --> 00:39:59,767
I'm wondering, how did
the staff end up in Europe,

844
00:39:59,800 --> 00:40:00,902
where Greece is at?

845
00:40:02,703 --> 00:40:06,040
Oh, gee-whiz, mister,
sorry I took your cane.

846
00:40:06,073 --> 00:40:07,108
You want it back?

847
00:40:10,945 --> 00:40:13,080
I mean, I did break it in half
and then throw it away.

848
00:40:13,114 --> 00:40:15,549
So, that's probably
where the journey started.

849
00:40:15,583 --> 00:40:16,717
-You know?
-What?

850
00:40:16,751 --> 00:40:18,085
What do you mean,
"What?" What?

851
00:40:18,119 --> 00:40:19,787
-You just left it there?
-We were all there.

852
00:40:19,820 --> 00:40:21,923
Guys, I had a staff.
I gave you all superpowers.

853
00:40:21,956 --> 00:40:23,724
You're welcome, by the way.

854
00:40:23,758 --> 00:40:24,992
And then I had to break it
in half so Sivana didn't do

855
00:40:25,026 --> 00:40:27,061
super bad-guy stuff with it,
okay?

856
00:40:27,094 --> 00:40:28,729
You broke the staff,

857
00:40:28,763 --> 00:40:30,665
meaning you broke the barrier
between worlds.

858
00:40:30,698 --> 00:40:31,899
Which we now know.

859
00:40:31,933 --> 00:40:33,868
We also now know
what they look like,

860
00:40:33,901 --> 00:40:35,703
so when they come to hunt us,
we'll see those two

870
00:40:57,959 --> 00:40:59,093

871
00:41:00,628 --> 00:41:03,030
that you may have feelings
for Freddy.

00:46:10,437 --> 00:46:11,839
[Freddy] I'm sorry,

964
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:13,240
I'm sorry, just,
just save yourself.

965
00:46:13,274 --> 00:46:15,943
No, no, all or none.
We stick together.

966
00:46:15,976 --> 00:46:18,879
And that you will
because you cannot leave.

967

Let's see how you like being
sealed off in a dying world.

00:46:22,983 --> 00:46:24,985
[Freddy] No!

969
00:46:25,019 --> 00:46:26,120
No!

You're the wizard! Oh, my...

You're back! Billy told me
all about you.

Billy? You know Billy Batson?

Billy Batson. Yeah,
he's my best friend.

It's complicated now.

She... It's complicated.

That halfwit Billy
gave you the powers of Shazam?

996
00:47:46,433 --> 00:47:49,470
Yeah, he did. And he said
that you turned into ash,

[grunts]

Once I gave him the power,

999

I could no longer remain
in my realm.

1000
00:47:55,577 --> 00:47:57,311
But death would have
been a luxury

1001
00:47:57,344 --> 00:47:59,313
compared to being trapped
in this cell

with the knowledge
of my failure, and with you.

A cranky wizard
with a cynical streak

There is no way these sisters

-Please, stop talking.

1015
00:48:27,307 --> 00:48:28,442
How about an arcane focus?

1016
00:48:28,475 --> 00:48:30,144
I don't even know
what that is.

Fine, then let's make

1019
00:48:33,247 --> 00:48:35,382

Oh! Gaseous form!

Yeah! Maybe we could
float out of here like a fart.

1022
00:48:39,654 --> 00:48:43,157
I gave my powers to children
who squandered it.

We will die here, Freeby.

It's Freddy, by the way.
"Freeby"? Where do you even...

The sooner you accept it,

the easier it will be.

These are primordial forces.

1033
00:49:12,152 --> 00:49:14,054
I don't know how we fight
powers like this.

1034
00:49:14,087 --> 00:49:15,989
I tell you how we fight it.

1035
00:49:16,023 --> 00:49:17,424
With the wisdom of...

-Solomon.
-Exactly.

1037
00:49:20,595 --> 00:49:22,463
We, we set up a meeting.

1038
00:49:22,496 --> 00:49:25,032
Yeah, we tell 'em we want
to negotiate.

1039
00:49:25,065 --> 00:49:27,201
Offer up our powers
for Freddy.

1040
00:49:27,234 --> 00:49:29,136
But then we grab one of them

1041
00:49:29,169 --> 00:49:31,004
and that's what we really use
to trade!

1042
00:49:31,038 --> 00:49:32,507
But what if they steal
our powers?

1043
00:49:32,540 --> 00:49:34,676
No, they won't, 'cause we know
how they work now.

1044
00:49:34,709 --> 00:49:37,344
You know what I mean?
If they just point
that staff at us, we dodge.

1045
00:49:37,377 --> 00:49:40,080
[imitates whooshing sounds]
Like dodgeball.

1046
00:49:40,113 --> 00:49:42,282
-Hmm.
-Dude, I suck at dodgeball.

1047
00:49:42,316 --> 00:49:44,318
Well, maybe Pedro sucks
at dodgeball,

1048
00:49:44,351 --> 00:49:45,687
but not Super Pedro.

1049
00:49:45,720 --> 00:49:48,088
No, Super Pedro also sucks
at dodgeball.

1050
00:49:48,121 --> 00:49:51,124
Fine. Listen, all I know
is that there's five of us
and three of them.

1051
00:49:51,158 --> 00:49:53,427
So I think we should
send them a little invitation.

Okay.

1053

So, Steve says that this paper

1054
00:49:59,233 --> 00:50:01,368
is a stack
of magical parchment.

1055
00:50:01,401 --> 00:50:03,337
You write a message
on the magical paper

1056
00:50:03,370 --> 00:50:06,340
and say the name of the god
that you would like to talk to

into a...

bird letters right now?

Hey, Steve, do I just
dictate to...

1066

I do. Okay, cool, wad that up.

No, no, no!

1071

of the letter.

Yeah, wow, very, um,

The other Champions...

1084

are they children
like yourself?

like, every week-ish.

Yes or no?

1088
00:51:37,532 --> 00:51:39,667
No. Your answer is no
because nobody's stupid enough

1089
00:51:39,701 --> 00:51:43,337
to grant primordial god-like
powers to a bunch of kids.

1090
00:51:43,370 --> 00:51:46,741
-Give us their names.
-The names of the Champions?

1091
00:51:46,774 --> 00:51:50,912
Um, well, there's
Brett Breyer,
and, uh, Burke Breyer.

1092
00:51:50,945 --> 00:51:52,446

this stuff in?

That's your superpower,
not mine.

you're a total control freak.

and shatters it whole.

Oh. [chuckles]
My mind is already trash,

so I'd actually like
to see you try.

Because nobody has the balls

Stop.

[breathing shakily]

1126
00:53:10,457 --> 00:53:11,826
This is from the Champions.

1127
00:53:13,528 --> 00:53:15,295
"Dear daughters of Atlas,

1128
00:53:15,328 --> 00:53:17,699
violence is not the answer.

1129
00:53:17,732 --> 00:53:21,501
Oh, good first sentence.
Thanks, Darla.

1130
00:53:21,536 --> 00:53:23,303
-We'd like to make a trade.
-What?

1131
00:53:23,336 --> 00:53:24,772
We'll give up our powers

1132
00:53:24,806 --> 00:53:28,241
if you give us Freddy,
add 'unharmed.'

1133

Otherwise, they're gonna
monkey's-paw you.

1134
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:32,680
Smart, Eugene.

1135
00:53:32,714 --> 00:53:34,982
Steve, add 'unharmed'

1136
00:53:35,016 --> 00:53:37,484
then, like, 'yours, trul...'

1137
00:53:37,518 --> 00:53:40,320
No, 'Sincerely, best'.

1138
00:53:40,353 --> 00:53:43,290
Maybe just signed
'The Champions.'

1139
00:53:43,323 --> 00:53:44,892
Should we proofread it?

1140
00:53:44,926 --> 00:53:47,294
Naw, Steve doesn't
make mistakes,

1141
00:53:47,327 --> 00:53:48,663
just writes what you say.

1142
00:53:48,696 --> 00:53:52,033
Great. I feel good
about this. Me, too.

1143
00:53:52,066 --> 00:53:55,002
Anyone else want a Gatorade?

1144
00:53:55,036 --> 00:53:56,436
Do we have red?"

1145
00:53:57,572 --> 00:53:59,941
What is this Gatorade?

-Throw them in the pit.
-[Anthea] Wait.

1151

They want to make a trade.

1152
00:54:16,423 --> 00:54:18,059
And we will meet, sister.

1153
00:54:18,092 --> 00:54:19,861
But humans are not
to be trusted.

1154
00:54:19,894 --> 00:54:23,598
The pit is just a bad name
for a fun place, right?

1155
00:54:24,498 --> 00:54:26,399
Right? [grunts]

Are you hurt?

1160
00:54:46,087 --> 00:54:48,723
No, just worthless.

1161
00:54:48,756 --> 00:54:51,324
-Well, you must get up.
-For what?

1162
00:54:51,358 --> 00:54:55,029
All this pretending
to be a superhero is just...

1163
00:54:55,062 --> 00:54:57,031
a way for me to pretend
I'm not broken.

1164

What is that?

1174
00:55:36,571 --> 00:55:37,839
Ladon.

1175

I don't feel okay at all.

That's the power
of the dragon.

It emanates fear
from every pore of its body.

Ladon's fear paralyzes
any mortal,

1187
00:56:21,749 --> 00:56:23,918
so that none can approach
the garden it protects.

The door back to your world
is at the center
of the labyrinth.

Right, left, left

from the bullies

-Hero.

Well, to be fair, I didn't
actually need your protection.

I was about to rearrange
those boys'

internal organs
when you stepped in.

1202
00:56:59,754 --> 00:57:02,455
But you didn't know that,
which does make you brave.

1203
00:57:02,489 --> 00:57:05,192
I was just brave because
I knew I had powers.

1204
00:57:05,226 --> 00:57:08,930
No, the most powerful thing
about you is you.

for both of you.

but we must get--

You should go. My sisters
don't need you anymore.

All they require now
is the seed.

1209

-The seed?
-Yes.

1210
00:57:23,544 --> 00:57:25,212
Which remains hidden
in a place unreachable

1211
00:57:25,246 --> 00:57:27,248
by any of their kind.
Come, come, Jeff. Faster.

this dome shit, man?

1218

Oh, no, no, no,
don't worry, sir.

1219
00:57:55,576 --> 00:57:56,844
[clicks tongue] I have a plan.

-Really?
-Uh-huh.

1221
00:57:58,279 --> 00:58:00,047
'Cause look like all you got
is a sandwich.

1222
00:58:00,081 --> 00:58:01,515
No, these sandwiches?

1223
00:58:01,549 --> 00:58:02,650
No, these sandwiches
are important.

1224
00:58:02,683 --> 00:58:04,051
They're, they're
for a meeting.

1225

Yeah, sure,
Colonel Cheesesteak. [scoffs]

Quiet one, she is.

1230
00:58:17,965 --> 00:58:20,634
I find it the most effective
way to slit an enemy's throat.

1231
00:58:20,668 --> 00:58:22,103
[chuckles nervously]

1232
00:58:22,136 --> 00:58:23,738
Is that...

1233
00:58:23,771 --> 00:58:25,639
Oh, you're totally serious.
Okay.

1234
00:58:25,673 --> 00:58:27,208
Uh...

1235
00:58:27,241 --> 00:58:30,111
Right, so, look, here's
the thing, um, you're upset.

1236
00:58:30,144 --> 00:58:31,979
A bunch of wizards came
and stole your powers,

1237
00:58:32,013 --> 00:58:34,281
which totally sucks balls,
I totally get it.

1238
00:58:34,315 --> 00:58:37,251
But, I kind of feel like
you're taking this all,

1239
00:58:37,284 --> 00:58:40,287
like, really personally
and, like, I don't even
know you, lady, right?

1240
00:58:40,321 --> 00:58:42,890
If thieves stormed your home
in the night

1241
00:58:42,923 --> 00:58:45,026
and stole all your coin
and then fled,

1242
00:58:45,059 --> 00:58:47,528
you would naturally
give chase, would you not?

1243
00:58:48,863 --> 00:58:50,564
And say, in this pursuit
the thieves

1244
00:58:50,598 --> 00:58:51,966
dropped the money
on the ground

1245
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:54,635
and your neighbor picked it up
and kept it.

1246
00:58:55,770 --> 00:58:58,639
Now, imagine it is not money,

1247
00:58:58,672 --> 00:59:00,875
but the lifeblood
of your father.

1248
00:59:00,908 --> 00:59:02,943
The last breath
of your mother.

1249
00:59:02,977 --> 00:59:05,279
The power of all the gods,

1250
00:59:05,312 --> 00:59:08,716
the magic of the entire realm
that was stolen.

1251
00:59:08,749 --> 00:59:11,252
And now this magic courses
through you,

1252
00:59:11,285 --> 00:59:13,154
and you have the gall

1253
00:59:13,187 --> 00:59:15,790
to believe
that you deserve it?

1254
00:59:17,758 --> 00:59:20,194
This is very personal,

1255
00:59:21,395 --> 00:59:22,596
Billy.

1256
00:59:25,299 --> 00:59:27,368
You are very menacing.

1257
00:59:27,401 --> 00:59:29,804
I just want you to know that.
Like, I really...

1258
00:59:29,837 --> 00:59:33,374
I see the presence
that you have,
and that goes a long way.

1259
00:59:33,407 --> 00:59:37,044
But today, I really wanted
to talk about compromise.

1260
00:59:37,078 --> 00:59:39,013
[both] There is no compromise.

1261
00:59:39,046 --> 00:59:41,015
I knew you were gonna
say that.

1262
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,317
Wisdom of Saruman.
Don't mess with me, okay?

1263
00:59:43,350 --> 00:59:45,986
Give us back Freddy,
you take down this

1264
00:59:46,020 --> 00:59:49,190
sphere-y dome-y
magic bowl thing

1265
00:59:49,223 --> 00:59:50,891
and then, you know,

1266
00:59:50,925 --> 00:59:52,626
we won't have to annihilate
you into the ground.

1267
00:59:52,660 --> 00:59:53,861
-[scoffs]
-It's a good offer.

1268
00:59:53,894 --> 00:59:55,029
I'm being serious.

1269
00:59:55,062 --> 00:59:57,765
You play the part of a man,

1270
00:59:57,798 --> 01:00:00,134
but you do not play it well.

1271
01:00:00,167 --> 01:00:02,603
Give us the powers, child.

1272
01:00:03,170 --> 01:00:04,972
All of them.

1273
01:00:05,005 --> 01:00:06,841
You are no leader, Billy.

1274

01:09:07,782 --> 01:09:10,384
It's over, sisters.

1432
01:09:10,417 --> 01:09:12,854
Now we can plant the seed
and restore our realm.

1433
01:09:14,522 --> 01:09:17,659
Or we plant it in their realm.

1434
01:09:17,692 --> 01:09:21,194
But that would destroy
their world.

1435
01:09:21,228 --> 01:09:23,497
Just as they destroyed ours.

1436
01:09:23,531 --> 01:09:25,667
[Hespera] You can't be serious.

1437
01:09:25,700 --> 01:09:27,568
-Yes.
-[Anthea] No.

1438
01:09:27,602 --> 01:09:29,202
No, that's not
what we agreed to.

1439
01:09:29,236 --> 01:09:30,805
[Kalypso] Anthea,
you simpering bore.

1440
01:09:30,838 --> 01:09:32,507
[Hespera] She's right,
we've spent ages

1441
01:09:32,540 --> 01:09:33,941
waiting for this moment.

1442
01:09:33,975 --> 01:09:35,475
[Anthea] We have the seed.

1443
01:09:35,510 --> 01:09:37,444
We have the staff
and its powers.

1444
01:09:37,477 --> 01:09:38,813
[Hespera]
We are not squandering it

1445
01:09:38,846 --> 01:09:40,715
for your personal
satisfaction.

1446
01:09:40,748 --> 01:09:43,751
[whispering]
No, I should go, not you.

1447
01:09:43,785 --> 01:09:45,787
Look, I know
what you're thinking.

1448
01:09:45,820 --> 01:09:48,221
The kid with the crutch
doesn't exactly
sing "sneak thief."

1449
01:09:48,255 --> 01:09:50,558
But here's the deal.
Your knees crack like crazy
when you walk.

1450
01:09:50,591 --> 01:09:51,826
-It's pathetic.
-[knees crack]

1451
01:09:51,859 --> 01:09:52,927
See?

1452
01:09:53,995 --> 01:09:55,530
Fortune be with you, Freddy.

1453
01:09:55,563 --> 01:09:57,665
Thank you.
What did you just call me?

1454
01:09:58,599 --> 01:10:01,334
Freddy. Freddy Freeman.

1455
01:10:01,368 --> 01:10:04,706
[chuckles] That's it.
You nailed it.

1456
01:10:04,739 --> 01:10:06,406
I'll see you
on the other side.

1457
01:10:07,809 --> 01:10:09,342
[Hespera] Even if we did,
the Tree of Life

1458
01:10:09,376 --> 01:10:10,945
would not thrive
in their soil.

1459
01:10:10,978 --> 01:10:14,281
It would despoil, it would
disfigure into something...

1460
01:10:14,314 --> 01:10:15,616
[Kalypso] Monstrous?

1461
01:10:15,650 --> 01:10:17,985
That is what humans are.

1462
01:10:18,019 --> 01:10:20,988
It is only fitting
that we bring
our monsters to their world

1463
01:10:21,022 --> 01:10:23,624
and do to them
as they did to us.

1464
01:10:26,694 --> 01:10:28,863
[Anthea] We agreed
to restore balance

1465
01:10:28,896 --> 01:10:32,499
and vengeance has
great measure of weight
on those scales.

1466
01:10:32,533 --> 01:10:35,570
Anthea, humans are villains,
even to themselves.

1467
01:10:35,603 --> 01:10:37,538
-No, not all.
-All.

1468
01:10:37,572 --> 01:10:40,975
[Hespera] Sister,
I fear your rage
has gotten the better of you.

1469
01:10:41,008 --> 01:10:42,375
[Kalypso] Why?

1470
01:10:42,409 --> 01:10:44,712
Humans wreak havoc
and devastation,

1471
01:10:44,746 --> 01:10:46,881
then pray to the gods
to absolve them.

1472
01:10:46,914 --> 01:10:49,382
They actually pray
for order and peace

1473
01:10:49,416 --> 01:10:52,553
when all they do
is dismantle it at every turn.

1474
01:10:52,587 --> 01:10:54,789
Anthea, I want you
to take the apple

1475
01:10:54,822 --> 01:10:56,924
and plant it in our garden.

1476
01:10:58,425 --> 01:10:59,794
[Kalypso] Of course
you turn to her.

1477
01:10:59,827 --> 01:11:01,596
Father would be ashamed
of both of you.

1478
01:11:01,629 --> 01:11:03,430
-[object clatters]
-[Freddy yelps]

1479
01:11:03,463 --> 01:11:05,332
Where did that even come from?

1480
01:11:06,834 --> 01:11:08,770
-Hi!
-You favor her, Hespera,

1481
01:11:08,803 --> 01:11:10,505
and see how she betrays us.

1482
01:11:14,075 --> 01:11:15,676
Deliver him
to his proper fate, sister.

1483
01:11:15,710 --> 01:11:17,845
-No!
-[Kalypso] Kill him!

1484
01:11:21,481 --> 01:11:23,017
What is that?

1485
01:11:23,050 --> 01:11:24,919
[Shazam] Great question.
No idea.

1486
01:11:25,953 --> 01:11:27,655
But made you look.

1487
01:11:27,688 --> 01:11:28,856
Billy! [chuckles]

1488
01:11:30,658 --> 01:11:32,492
-Oh!
-Oh.

1489
01:11:32,527 --> 01:11:34,327
-[Freddy gasps]
-Your crutch!

1490
01:11:34,361 --> 01:11:37,330
-Oh! Shazam!
-[lightning cracks]

1491
01:11:37,364 --> 01:11:38,365
-Yes!
-No!

1492
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:44,337
So, we have a lot
to talk about.

1493
01:11:54,447 --> 01:11:56,651
Kalypso, hand me the staff.

1494
01:11:58,553 --> 01:12:00,054
You are not fit to wield it.

1495
01:12:00,087 --> 01:12:01,589
More fit than you.

1496
01:12:01,622 --> 01:12:03,356
You had him in your hands,
yet did nothing.

1497
01:12:03,390 --> 01:12:06,694
Our sole purpose is
to avenge our father,

1498
01:12:06,727 --> 01:12:08,796
but everyone here
has become weak.

1499
01:12:09,864 --> 01:12:12,033
Ladon, world-eater,

1500
01:12:12,934 --> 01:12:15,536
rise from the pit!

Where's he going?

[Rosa] Victor?

1512
01:12:46,000 --> 01:12:47,500
Victor, wake up.

1513
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:50,738
Hello. Oh, God, woman. What?

1514
01:12:50,771 --> 01:12:52,439
Dad. We gotta go!

1515
01:12:52,472 --> 01:12:54,575
-We gotta get out of here.
-We have to go right now!

1516
01:12:54,609 --> 01:12:56,811
This is funny, right?
I know what this looks like.

1517
01:12:56,844 --> 01:12:58,613
That's not true. I have
no idea what this looks like.

1518
01:12:58,646 --> 01:13:00,413
Just don't freak out.

Look at me, it's Billy.

And that's Eugene,

-It's me.

That's Darla
and that's Mary, obvi,

Guys, this is no time
for secrets, okay?

1528
01:13:16,130 --> 01:13:18,532
We have to tell 'em the truth.

-Oh.

-I'm the wizard.
-Oh, this is the wizard.

1534

He's a wizard who's called
"the wizard."

Okay, get dressed right now.
Come on, hurry up.

1536
01:13:33,114 --> 01:13:34,148
[superhero Darla]
Put on these clothes.

This is so weird.

[Shazam] Yep, yep.

You guys are
the Philly Fiascoes?

1540

Okay. This is in no way
an acknowledgement
of that stupid nickname

1541
01:13:43,124 --> 01:13:45,159
but, yes, that would be us.
Now can you pick up the pace?

01:13:45,192 --> 01:13:47,194
We have to go.
The dragon is here!

but I promise
to explain it all later.

[Victor] Explain what?

1553
01:14:35,810 --> 01:14:37,545
That our kids are superheroes
being hunted by Greek gods

1554
01:14:37,578 --> 01:14:39,113
that used a dragon to destroy
the house we just bought?

is a thing of beauty.

for the soil of this realm

by the hand that planted it.

Whose side is she on, anyway?
Do you...

1629
01:21:26,353 --> 01:21:28,455
I must try to sway Hespera.

1630
01:21:28,489 --> 01:21:30,491
Only she can subdue
our sister.

1631
01:21:30,525 --> 01:21:32,560
I will give it my all,
or die trying.

1632
01:21:32,594 --> 01:21:34,194
Die? No, I'm pretty sure

1633
01:21:34,228 --> 01:21:35,630
we can come up
with an alternative to dying.

1634
01:21:35,663 --> 01:21:38,298
My sweet Freddy,
I'm ready if need be.

1635
01:21:38,332 --> 01:21:40,000
I've lived a long life.

1636
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:41,468
What are you talking about,
"Lived a long life?"

1637
01:21:41,502 --> 01:21:42,403
We're the same age.
You're young. We're young.

1638
01:21:42,436 --> 01:21:44,438
I'm over 6,000 years old.

1639

-Oh?
-[chuckles]

Oh.

1642
01:21:55,349 --> 01:21:57,151
Suddenly seems inappropriate.

1643
01:21:57,184 --> 01:21:58,185
Yeah.

1644
01:22:06,160 --> 01:22:08,462
We can't let her die.
She called me sweet!

1645
01:22:08,495 --> 01:22:10,164
We have to figure
something out.

1646
01:22:11,365 --> 01:22:12,466
Take my powers back.

1647
01:22:12,499 --> 01:22:14,001
-No, Billy!
-No, no, no.

1648
01:22:14,034 --> 01:22:15,570
Hey, take my powers back.

1649
01:22:15,603 --> 01:22:17,004
You gave 'em to me, so you can
take 'em back, right?

1650
01:22:17,037 --> 01:22:19,206
I am no longer the champion.
You are!

1651
01:22:19,239 --> 01:22:20,374
You think I know
how to fix this, dude,

1652
01:22:20,407 --> 01:22:22,142
but I really don't, okay?

1653
01:22:22,176 --> 01:22:24,445
I, I didn't even know
who those Greek sisters were.

1654
01:22:24,478 --> 01:22:26,146
I had to Google them.
But you know who they are,

1655
01:22:26,180 --> 01:22:27,682
which means you know
what to do.

1656
01:22:27,715 --> 01:22:29,717
And you were right.

1657
01:22:29,751 --> 01:22:32,119
You picked
the wrong champion, man.

1658
01:22:32,152 --> 01:22:34,021
I mean, that's why I always
say "all or none," right?

1659
01:22:34,054 --> 01:22:36,190
Because without my family,
I'm nothing.

1660
01:22:39,326 --> 01:22:41,563
And honestly, I have no idea
what I'm doin'.

1661
01:22:41,596 --> 01:22:42,730
[wizard] No.

1662
01:22:42,764 --> 01:22:44,364
You don't have
a shred of wisdom

1663
01:22:44,398 --> 01:22:45,999
in that brain of yours.

1664
01:22:47,201 --> 01:22:49,637
But your heart is wise.

1665
01:22:49,671 --> 01:22:53,240
And it knows exactly
what must be done.

1666
01:22:53,273 --> 01:22:56,744
I spent millennia searching
for a worthy champion

1667
01:22:58,546 --> 01:23:00,481
and no one was worthy
of what I once shared

1668
01:23:00,515 --> 01:23:03,116
with my brothers and sisters.

1669
01:23:03,150 --> 01:23:04,752
But when you shared
your powers,

1670
01:23:06,286 --> 01:23:07,622
you did not hesitate.

1671
01:23:07,655 --> 01:23:10,123
For you, everyone
can be worthy

1672
01:23:10,157 --> 01:23:11,593
if given a chance.

1673
01:23:11,626 --> 01:23:15,128
Now, go fight for your family.

1674
01:23:15,162 --> 01:23:17,331
Go fight for the world.

1675
01:23:17,364 --> 01:23:19,567
I chose right
when I chose you.

1676
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:24,606
[Freddy] Billy?

1677
01:23:24,639 --> 01:23:26,508
Billy, what are we gonna do,
man?

1678
01:23:26,541 --> 01:23:29,577
Same thing we
always do, Freddy.
Save the God darn world.

1679
01:23:29,611 --> 01:23:31,378
Now, I'm gonna go
get that staff

1680
01:23:31,411 --> 01:23:33,247
and I need you to lure
these things away

1681
01:23:33,280 --> 01:23:36,083
from the stadium while I deal
with the dragon, all right?

1682
01:23:36,116 --> 01:23:37,752
Wait, wait, wait,
Billy, Billy.

1683
01:23:37,785 --> 01:23:40,153
Can I just see you,
before you go?

1684
01:23:40,187 --> 01:23:42,189
Not this version.

if I don't get eaten

We're a team! We're a team!

[Anthea] He was a hero.

2085
01:49:58,032 --> 01:50:00,401
He was a hero and a god.

2086
01:50:00,434 --> 01:50:02,736
And he should be laid
to rest like one.

Only the spark of a god
can restore its power

2094
01:51:26,120 --> 01:51:27,721
and there are no gods left.

What the hell?

2115
01:53:24,438 --> 01:53:26,373
You buried me?

2116

In what, like, two minutes?

Oh, man. I missed you guys.

Oh, my God. Hi.

2123
01:53:42,524 --> 01:53:44,258
Why didn't anybody tell...

2124
01:53:44,291 --> 01:53:46,226
Hi. Sorry, sorry,
I didn't, uh...

2125
01:53:46,260 --> 01:53:49,263
I didn't see you there,
I was, um, I was...

I was dead at the time.

So, you, uh...

2128
01:53:53,500 --> 01:53:54,968
you got my bird letter?

2129

Oh, I, uh...

What?

2134
01:54:07,615 --> 01:54:08,650
That's a spider.

2135
01:54:08,683 --> 01:54:10,317
I'm sorry, that's disgusting.

2136
01:54:10,351 --> 01:54:12,920
Also, [chuckling]
that's really embarrassing.

2137
01:54:12,953 --> 01:54:14,154
Yes, it is.

2138
01:54:14,188 --> 01:54:16,524
But it was an amazing thing
you did.

2139
01:54:16,558 --> 01:54:18,492
The sacrifice you made.

2140
01:54:18,526 --> 01:54:21,495
You brought this world
back to life.

Maybe this time,
gods and humans

can learn to live in peace.

2143

Yeah.

2144
01:54:28,001 --> 01:54:29,937
Use the power of Zeus wisely.

Be well, Billy Batson.

Hey, you know, just because
your father's power

is surging through me,

2148

that doesn't technically
make us related, you know,

-Yeah.
-Yeah. Okay, good.

our house back.

[Rosa] Anthea.

2169
01:55:21,188 --> 01:55:22,389
Have you decided what
you're gonna do

2170
01:55:22,423 --> 01:55:25,159
about that god realm of yours?

2171

Well, actually I'm gonna take
some time off while it heals.

2172
01:55:27,762 --> 01:55:29,731
Spend some time
with the common folk.

2173
01:55:29,764 --> 01:55:31,398
Learn some about your world,

2174
01:55:31,432 --> 01:55:34,034
about how, maybe,
we can learn from each other.

more to learn.

2177
01:55:37,539 --> 01:55:38,972
I'm coming around to it.

[doorbell rings]

2179
01:55:40,775 --> 01:55:42,109
I got it.

2180
01:55:46,413 --> 01:55:47,414
Whoa.

2181
01:55:48,248 --> 01:55:49,517
Uh, guys?

2182
01:55:50,317 --> 01:55:51,351
Guys!

[suspenseful music playing]

01:56:03,531 --> 01:56:05,265
-Yes.
-Look at this guy!

2187
01:56:05,299 --> 01:56:06,601
Look at him, he's so handsome.

2188
01:56:06,634 --> 01:56:08,135
You pimpin' now, what is this?

2189
01:56:08,168 --> 01:56:09,704
-[Billy] You look amazing.
-You look great!

2190
01:56:09,737 --> 01:56:12,039
Well, I was
in the neighborhood

2191
01:56:12,072 --> 01:56:13,575
and, um, I just wanted
to express

2192
01:56:13,608 --> 01:56:16,109
-my gratitude before I go.
-[doorbell rings, pops]

-[Freddy chuckles]
-Not everything.

2195
01:56:25,052 --> 01:56:26,588
You were just
in the neighborhood?

2196
01:56:26,621 --> 01:56:29,122
[chuckles] Okay,
I came for the staff.

2197
01:56:29,156 --> 01:56:31,158
Perhaps I will hold
onto it for now.

2198
01:56:31,191 --> 01:56:35,128
I also wanted to see
your faces one last time

2199
01:56:35,162 --> 01:56:36,764
before I turn into a pile
of ash.

2200
01:56:36,798 --> 01:56:38,398
-Wait, what?
-No!

2201
01:56:38,432 --> 01:56:40,467
I am making a joke.
I have an Uber waiting.

2202
01:56:40,501 --> 01:56:42,369
-And besides...
-[chuckles]

2203
01:56:42,402 --> 01:56:45,205
...I've been trapped in rocks
and prisons for far too long.

2204
01:56:45,239 --> 01:56:47,207
It's time to see your world.

2205
01:56:47,241 --> 01:56:48,743
It's been an honor,

2206
01:56:48,776 --> 01:56:51,478
a privilege,
watching you all soar.

2207
01:56:51,513 --> 01:56:52,780
You know, you're not such
a bad wizard.

2208
01:56:52,814 --> 01:56:54,348
Thank you, Jeff.

2209
01:56:54,381 --> 01:56:56,216
-[sighs] It never ends.
-[chuckles]

2210
01:56:57,552 --> 01:56:58,553
[Billy] Also,

2211
01:57:00,120 --> 01:57:01,556
what's my superhero name?

2212
01:57:04,191 --> 01:57:06,460
Your name is...

2213
01:57:07,494 --> 01:57:09,396
Shazam.

2214
01:57:09,429 --> 01:57:10,464
-Of course.
-Yeah.

2215
01:57:10,497 --> 01:57:12,534
[all agreeing]

2216
01:57:14,268 --> 01:57:16,503
I still think we can beat it.

2217
01:57:16,538 --> 01:57:18,540
[upbeat music playing]

2218
01:59:55,763 --> 01:59:57,431
My feet hurt.
How much further?

2219
01:59:57,464 --> 01:59:58,666
About ten seconds less

2220
01:59:58,700 --> 02:00:00,333
than the last time
you asked me.

2221
02:00:00,367 --> 02:00:01,803
I'm sorry, I just feel
like we could

2222
02:00:01,836 --> 02:00:03,270
have parked
a little bit closer.

2223
02:00:03,303 --> 02:00:04,438
He doesn't know we're coming,

2224
02:00:04,471 --> 02:00:05,840
and I didn't want
to spook him.

2225
02:00:05,873 --> 02:00:08,341
"Spook him."
He's a superhero, not a deer.

2226
02:00:08,375 --> 02:00:09,711
All right, let's go.

2227
02:00:09,744 --> 02:00:11,779
And then you can tell Waller
that even though

2228
02:00:11,813 --> 02:00:13,981
she thinks this guy could be
a good addition to the team,

2229
02:00:14,015 --> 02:00:15,616
we never actually met him

2230
02:00:15,650 --> 02:00:17,985
because you wore
shitty walking shoes.

2231
02:00:18,019 --> 02:00:19,921
[chuckles] Okay, first of all,
they're boots,

2232
02:00:19,954 --> 02:00:21,889
and they're not shitty,
they're new.

2233
02:00:21,923 --> 02:00:24,892
-I just haven't had a chance
to break them in yet.
-Shut up.

2234
02:00:24,926 --> 02:00:27,962
Waller said this guy
is as powerful as they come,

2235
02:00:27,995 --> 02:00:29,764
but a little immature.

2236
02:00:29,797 --> 02:00:30,932
Oh, great.

2237
02:00:31,833 --> 02:00:34,468
Whoo! [chuckles]

2238
02:00:39,306 --> 02:00:41,308
[grunting]

2239
02:00:43,410 --> 02:00:44,879
-Billy Batson.
-Yeah?

2240
02:00:44,912 --> 02:00:46,681
I mean, no.

2241
02:00:46,714 --> 02:00:48,415
I've never heard that name
in my life.

2242
02:00:48,448 --> 02:00:49,751
I don't know who
you're talking about.

2243
02:00:49,784 --> 02:00:51,418
But I'd like to meet
that person

2244
02:00:51,451 --> 02:00:53,286
'cause they sound super cool.
And funny.

2245
02:00:53,320 --> 02:00:55,990
And talented.
And ridiculously handsome,

2246
02:00:56,023 --> 02:00:57,625
but, like, in a dangerous way.

2247
02:00:57,658 --> 02:00:59,560
What the hell
are you talking about?

2248
02:00:59,594 --> 02:01:01,696
Relax. We know who you are.

2249
02:01:01,729 --> 02:01:03,865
-How?
-Don't worry about that.

2250
02:01:04,899 --> 02:01:05,933
Who are you guys?

2251
02:01:05,967 --> 02:01:07,434
Don't worry about that either.

2252
02:01:07,467 --> 02:01:09,302
Look, we've seen
what you can do.

2253
02:01:09,336 --> 02:01:10,872
And we're here
to make you an offer.

2254
02:01:10,905 --> 02:01:11,973
How would you like to join

2255
02:01:12,006 --> 02:01:13,340
-the Justice...
-Yes!

2256
02:01:13,373 --> 02:01:14,742
A thousand times yes!

2257
02:01:14,776 --> 02:01:16,677
Oh, my gosh!
I've been dreaming about this!

2258
02:01:16,711 --> 02:01:18,679
Well, I mean,
not this exactly.

2259
02:01:18,713 --> 02:01:19,747
Like, normally,
it's Wonder Woman

2260
02:01:19,781 --> 02:01:20,948
in the dream, but...

2261
02:01:20,982 --> 02:01:22,550
-Ew.
-Huh?

2262
02:01:22,583 --> 02:01:24,719
Well, that was easy.

2263
02:01:24,752 --> 02:01:26,386
Welcome
to the Justice Society.

2264
02:01:26,419 --> 02:01:28,421
Yeah! Aweso... Wait, what?

2265
02:01:28,455 --> 02:01:29,690
The Justice Society?

2266
02:01:29,724 --> 02:01:31,025
Is that different
than the Justice League?

2267
02:01:31,058 --> 02:01:32,794
Yes. The Justice Society

2268
02:01:32,827 --> 02:01:34,361
is different
than the Justice League

2269
02:01:34,394 --> 02:01:36,030
because of how words work.

2270
02:01:36,063 --> 02:01:37,999
I just want to be
in the Wonder Woman group.

2271
02:01:38,032 --> 02:01:40,433
-So, that's you guys, right?
-No.

2272
02:01:40,467 --> 02:01:42,435
Why are you so obsessed
with Wonder Woman, dude?

2273
02:01:42,469 --> 02:01:44,371
He's joking, right?

2274
02:01:44,404 --> 02:01:47,642
-No?
-Okay. I'm out.

2275
02:01:47,675 --> 02:01:49,677
I'm gonna wait here,
'cause of the shoes.

2276
02:01:49,710 --> 02:01:51,712
Can you drive by and get me?

2277
02:01:51,746 --> 02:01:54,115
[Shazam] Hey, just a little
constructive criticism.

2278
02:01:54,148 --> 02:01:55,583
It's pretty confusing
that there are

2279
02:01:55,616 --> 02:01:57,618
two separate groups
of superheroes

2280
02:01:57,652 --> 02:01:59,053
that are totally unaffiliated,

2281
02:01:59,086 --> 02:02:01,122
but both have "Justice"
in their name, you know.

2282
02:02:01,155 --> 02:02:03,423
Like, have you guys ever
thought about doing
a rebranding of sorts?

2283
02:02:03,456 --> 02:02:06,127
'Cause just a quick search
on Thesaurus.com,

2284
02:02:06,160 --> 02:02:08,029
you got so many options, man.

2285
02:02:08,062 --> 02:02:11,098
Like, "Authority Society." Eh?

2286
02:02:11,132 --> 02:02:12,900
Uh, uh, "Code Society."
That's stupid.

2287
02:02:12,934 --> 02:02:14,467
These are, like, legal terms.

2288
02:02:14,501 --> 02:02:17,605
[gasps] "The Avenger Society."

2289
02:02:17,638 --> 02:02:19,006
[inhales sharply]

2290
02:02:19,040 --> 02:02:20,608
I like that, for some reason.

2291
02:02:23,476 --> 02:02:25,478
[gentle music playing]

2292
02:02:40,728 --> 02:02:42,897
[music builds up]

2293
02:02:49,704 --> 02:02:51,706
[dramatic music playing]

2294
02:06:05,766 --> 02:06:07,768
[mysterious music playing]

2295
02:07:33,988 --> 02:07:35,990
[intense music playing]

2296
02:08:34,181 --> 02:08:36,217
[distant chattering]

2297
02:08:36,250 --> 02:08:38,252
[unsettling music playing]

2298
02:08:53,901 --> 02:08:56,070
[voice laughing]

2299
02:08:56,103 --> 02:09:00,140
[Mister Mind] Well, well,
Doctor. We meet again.

2300
02:09:00,174 --> 02:09:02,042
Where in the hell
have you been?

2301
02:09:02,076 --> 02:09:05,112
[Mister Mind] To implement
the perfect plan, Doctor,

2302
02:09:05,145 --> 02:09:07,414
one must have patience.

2303
02:09:07,448 --> 02:09:09,016
What are you talking about?

2304
02:09:10,585 --> 02:09:12,486
It's been two goddamn years!

2305
02:09:12,520 --> 02:09:17,458
Yes. But what is time
but a trick of the mind?

2306
02:09:17,491 --> 02:09:18,993
A meaningless measure.

2307
02:09:19,026 --> 02:09:21,529
Hey. I'm 57 years old.

2308
02:09:21,563 --> 02:09:24,965
I'm stuck in a concrete box
surrounded by lunatics

2309
02:09:24,999 --> 02:09:26,967
waiting for a worm to enact
some, what,

2310
02:09:27,001 --> 02:09:29,403
vague plan I've been told
absolutely nothing about?

2311
02:09:29,436 --> 02:09:32,172
It takes me a very long time
to get places, okay?

2312
02:09:32,206 --> 02:09:35,042
I do not have legs,
I do not have wings,

2313
02:09:35,075 --> 02:09:38,412
I just slither around
endlessly.

2314
02:09:38,445 --> 02:09:41,015
But not for long.

2315
02:09:41,048 --> 02:09:42,449
[laughing]

2316
02:09:43,884 --> 02:09:45,419
Tell me everything.

2317
02:09:47,054 --> 02:09:49,123
Just one more thing
I need to do.

2318
02:09:49,156 --> 02:09:51,158
What? No!

2319
02:09:52,594 --> 02:09:52,661
Oh, goddamn it!

2319
02:09:53,305 --> 02:10:53,876
